## thresholds.yaml

Controls the two-tier acceptance model for `eforge eval`. Each sub-score has a **minimum** (hard gate: dataset fails if below) and an **aspirational** target (informational stretch goal). Pillar weights must sum to 1.0.

When a generated dataset includes `OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json` beside `GROUND_TRUTH.md`,
`eforge eval` automatically applies observation-aware coverage scoring. Non-`complete`
profiles can adjust only coverage-style causality sub-scores (`event_presence`,
`pivot_linkability`, `temporal_integrity`, and `storyline_trace_coverage`) by excluding
evidence that the manifest marks `dropped`, `filtered`, or `out_of_window`. Source-native
correctness gates such as parseability, value plausibility, field agreement, and visible causal
ordering remain strict. Adjusted sub-scores expose `raw_score` in JSON and show `raw:<score>` in
the text report.

`plausibility.ids_integrity` is a special zero-weight 100% hard gate. It validates
the bounded `GROUND_TRUTH.json.ids_evaluation` contract against parsed,
sensor-provenanced Snort rows and `OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json`. Its zero weight
keeps the overall numeric score unchanged while any count, digest, origin, tuple,
timestamp, filtering, or observation contradiction fails acceptance. Legacy
ground truth without the section skips the gate unless the supplied scenario
authors `ids_alerts`, in which case absence is a failure.

## co_occurrence.yaml

Pillar 2 (Plausibility) co-occurrence checks. Each rule verifies that when a condition matches in a generated record, required field constraints hold. These catch records where fields are inconsistent with each other, including impossible combinations.

### Structure

```yaml
format_name:                                    # Top-level key matches format name
  - name: "Network logon (type 3) requires valid IP"  # Human-readable rule name
    condition:                                   # When this condition matches...
      EventID: 4624
      LogonType: 3
      exclude:                                   # Optional exclusion filter
        TargetUserName: "ANONYMOUS LOGON"
    checks:                                      # ...these constraints must hold
      - field: IpAddress
        not_equal: "-"
      - field: IpAddress
        not_equal: ""
```

### Condition Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `{field_name}: value` | any | Field must equal this value for the rule to apply |
| `exclude` | object | If any exclusion field matches, skip this rule |

### Check Types

| Check | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `not_equal` | any | Field value must NOT equal this |
| `present` | bool | Field must be present (if `true`) |
| `min_length` | int | Field string length must be at least this |
| `matches` | string | Field must match this regex pattern |

### Impossible-combo rules (examples to add)

- `LogonType: 3` + workstation target → should not originate from the same workstation (lateral movement indicator, not a co-occurrence violation per se, but `IpAddress` must differ from `Computer`)
- TLS 1.0 + ECDHE or CHACHA20 cipher suites → impossible combination
- Zeek `conn` with `SF` state + `duration: 0` → connection with data but zero duration
- HTTP `CONNECT` method + non-empty response body in `zeek_http` → tunneled connections don't have bodies

---

## distributions.yaml

Pillar 2 (Plausibility) population statistics checks. Defines expected distributions for field values across all generated records, with divergence tolerances. Used to verify that the overall data mix is realistic.

### Structure

```yaml
format_name:                          # Top-level key matches format name
  - field: EventID                    # Field to check distribution of
    reference:                        # Expected distribution (proportions sum to ~1.0)
      4624: 0.20                      # Logon events = 20%
      4625: 0.03                      # Failed logon = 3%
      4634: 0.15                      # Logoff = 15%
      4688: 0.20                      # Process creation = 20%
      4689: 0.12                      # Process termination = 12%
    tolerance: 0.30                   # Max divergence from reference (0.30 = 30%)
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `field` | string | yes | Field name to check distribution of |
| `reference` | object | yes | Map of value -> expected proportion. Should sum to ~1.0. |
| `tolerance` | float | yes | Maximum acceptable divergence (e.g., 0.30 = 30% deviation from reference). Uses Jensen-Shannon divergence. |

### Conventions

- Proportions are educated estimates, not ground truth
- Values don't need to sum to exactly 1.0 (they represent relative proportions)
- Higher `tolerance` means more lenient checking
- Formats to add: `zeek_http`, `zeek_ssl`, `cisco_asa`

## causal_pairs.yaml

Pillar 3 (Causality) temporal ordering checks. Each pair defines a "before" event and an "after" event that must be correctly ordered when they share matching field values.

### Structure

```yaml
pairs:
  - name: "Logon before process creation"        # Human-readable pair name
    before:
      format: windows_event_security              # Format of the "before" event
      condition:
        EventID: 4624                             # Condition to match
    after:
      format: windows_event_security              # Format of the "after" event
      condition:
        EventID: 4688
    match_fields:                                  # Fields that must match to form a pair
      before: TargetLogonId                       # Field name in the "before" event
      after: SubjectLogonId                       # Field name in the "after" event
    extra_match: hostname                          # Optional: additional field that must match
    exclude_accounts:                              # Optional: accounts to skip
      - "SYSTEM"
      - "LOCAL SERVICE"
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable description of the causal relationship |
| `before` | object | yes | The event that must occur first |
| `before.format` | string | yes | Format name |
| `before.condition` | object | yes | Field-value pairs to match |
| `after` | object | yes | The event that must occur second |
| `after.format` | string | yes | Format name |
| `after.condition` | object | yes | Field-value pairs to match |
| `match_fields` | object | yes | Which fields link the two events |
| `match_fields.before` | string | yes | Field name in the before event |
| `match_fields.after` | string | yes | Field name in the after event |
| `extra_match` | string | no | Additional field that must match in both events |
| `exclude_accounts` | list[string] | no | Account names to exclude from checking |

### Conventions

- Causal pairs must be logically sequential (logon -> process creation, not the reverse)
- `exclude_accounts` should list system accounts that don't follow normal causal chains
- Cross-format pairs are supported (e.g., eCAR LOGIN before PROCESS CREATE)
- `match_fields` links the events — the before event's field value must equal the after event's field value

## timing_bounds.yaml

Per-storyline-transition elapsed-time bounds for the `attack_chain_timing` sub-score. The scorer checks that the time between consecutive storyline events falls within the applicable bounds.

Activity matching is case-insensitive substring match on `StorylineEvent.activity`. The first matching `action_overrides` key wins; defaults apply when no override matches.

### Structure

```yaml
defaults:
  min_seconds: 5         # Minimum realistic gap between any two consecutive attack steps
  max_seconds: 7200      # Maximum (2 hours default); longer gaps fail

action_overrides:
  lateral_movement:
    min_seconds: 30
    max_seconds: 3600
  exfiltration:
    min_seconds: 60
    max_seconds: 86400   # 24 hours — slow exfil is realistic
  recon:
    min_seconds: 1
    max_seconds: 1800
  # ... add more keywords as needed
```

### How to add a custom override

Add a new key under `action_overrides`. The key is a substring of the storyline `activity` field (case-insensitive). Example: adding `"deploy"` covers activities like "Deploy persistence mechanism" or "Deploy beacon stager".

---

## cross_source_pairs.yaml

Maps pairs of log formats to the fields that must agree when the same underlying event appears in both. Used by the `field_agreement` sub-score (pivot-key join approach).

Each pair definition joins format_a and format_b on a pivot key, then checks that `agree_on` fields carry matching values.

### Full Structure

```yaml
pairs:
  - name: "Human-readable pair label"
    format_a: <format name>
    format_b: <format name>
    condition_a:                   # optional: filter format_a records
      FieldName: value
    condition_b:                   # optional: filter format_b records
      msg_id_in: [302013, 302014]  # special: match msg_id against a list
    pivot_key:
      # Single-field pivot:
      a_field: NewProcessId
      b_field: pid
      coerce: hex_to_int           # optional: "hex_to_int" converts "0x1A2B" → 6699
      require_hostname_match: true # optional: join only records on same host
      time_window_seconds: 60      # optional: discard matches >N seconds apart
      # Multi-field pivot (AND join):
      a_fields: ["id.orig_h", "id.resp_p"]
      b_fields: [src_ip, dst_port]
      # list_contains pivot (a_field is a list, each element → lookup b_field):
      a_field: cert_chain_fuids
      b_field: id
      list_contains: true
    agree_on:
      - a_field: NewProcessName
        b_field: image_path
        b_nested: properties       # optional: b_field is inside a nested dict
        normalize: path_basename_ci  # optional: "lower", "path_basename_ci", "cn_from_dn"
        tolerance: 0.10            # optional: numeric ±fraction tolerance
        b_is_list: true            # optional: b_field is a list; a_field must appear in it
```

### Implemented pairs

| Pair | Pivot | agree_on |
|------|-------|----------|
| Windows 4688 ↔ eCAR PROCESS/CREATE | PID + hostname (60s window) | process basename, username |
| Zeek conn ↔ Cisco ASA flow | 4-tuple (orig_h/resp_h/orig_p/resp_p ↔ src/dst/port) | *(pivot match itself is the assertion)* |
| web_access ↔ zeek_http | (client_ip, path/uri, 10s bucket) | status_code, method |
| proxy_access ↔ zeek_http | (client_ip, url/uri, 10s bucket); CONNECT rows excluded | status_code, method |
| zeek_ssl ↔ zeek_x509 | cert_chain_fuids list → x509 id; leaf certs only (host_cert=true) | server_name ∈ san.dns |

### Loader

Uses the shared `load_rules_file("cross_source_pairs.yaml")` from `evidenceforge.evaluation.rules`.
