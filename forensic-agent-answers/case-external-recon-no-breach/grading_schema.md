# Grading Schema — external-recon-no-breach

Total: 100. Applied per the process in this directory's `AGENTS.md`.

## Q1 — Characterize the scan (20 pts)
**Expected:** Source `203.0.113.77`, destination `10.30.30.10` (`WEB-01`),
21 distinct ports probed, `2024-06-11 14:09:59`-`14:10:02` UTC. Cites
Event ID `106023` (and/or `302013`/`302014`) in `cisco_asa.log`.
**Full credit:** All four facts (source, destination, port count, time
window) correct, with the specific ASA message type cited.
**Partial:** 2-3 of the four facts correct/cited.
**Zero:** Wrong source or destination, or no specific log-message
citation at all.

## Q2 — Ports that got through (25 pts)
**Expected:** Two ports, 443 and 22. Port 443: Zeek `conn_state: RSTO`,
connection reset almost immediately, no data exchanged (`orig_bytes: 53`,
`resp_bytes: 0`). Port 22: Zeek `conn_state: SF`, `service: ssh`, clean
close after a completed exchange (`orig_bytes: 98`, `resp_bytes: 674`).
**Full credit:** Both ports identified, correct `conn_state` for each,
and a correct (even if brief) description of what happened on each —
not just "these two got through."
**Partial:** Both ports identified but `conn_state`/outcome details
missing or wrong for one or both; or only one of the two ports found.
**Zero:** Wrong ports named, or asserts all 21 were denied (missing both
real connections), or asserts a successful exploit/compromise via
either connection.

## Q3 — The SSH authentication attempt (20 pts)
**Expected:** Failed. Evidence: `WEB-01`'s `syslog.log` — "Invalid user
unknown," "Failed password for invalid user unknown," "Connection
closed by invalid user unknown ... [preauth]." No successful-auth log
line exists anywhere in this data.
**Full credit:** Correctly states the attempt failed, citing the actual
syslog lines (not just the Zeek `conn_state: SF`, which only shows the
TCP session closed cleanly — SF does NOT mean the login succeeded, and
an answer that reasons from `conn_state` alone without checking the
host-level auth log has the right instinct but the wrong evidence).
**Partial:** Correct conclusion (failed) but only cites the network-level
connection record, not the host-level syslog auth-failure lines the
question specifically asks for.
**Zero:** States the login succeeded, or states no authentication was
attempted at all (missing it entirely).

## Q4 — Policy comparison (15 pts)
**Expected:** Partial mismatch. Port 443 being reachable matches stated
policy (80/443 are supposed to be reachable). Port 22 (SSH) responding
to an external connection does NOT match policy — `ENVIRONMENT.md`
states SSH should only be reachable internally, never from the internet.
**Full credit:** Correctly identifies the SSH-exposure mismatch
specifically (not just a generic "some things matched, some didn't"),
and correctly does NOT flag port 443 as a mismatch.
**Partial:** Notices something doesn't match policy but doesn't specify
which port or why.
**Zero:** States everything matched policy (missing the SSH mismatch
entirely), or flags port 443 as a policy violation (it isn't).

## Q5 — Compromise conclusion + report (20 pts)
**Expected:** No evidence of compromise, persistence, or follow-on
activity anywhere in the data — on any host. Report should convey: (a)
a scan happened and one weak/generic SSH probe attempt failed; (b) no
compromise occurred; (c) the SSH-exposure policy gap from Q4 is worth
fixing regardless of whether this specific scan succeeded; (d) a
recommendation scaled to reality (e.g., "close SSH to the internet on
WEB-01" / "confirm no other DMZ hosts have the same exposure" — not
"activate incident response" and not "nothing happened, no action
needed").
**Full credit (fact-finding, 10 pts):** Correctly concludes no
compromise, checked across hosts (not just the web server).
**Full credit (report, LLM-judge, holistic, 10 pts):** Proportionate
tone, includes the SSH-exposure recommendation, doesn't over-alarm or
dismiss.
**Zero (either half):** Asserts compromise occurred with no supporting
evidence; or a report that either escalates to "breach" language or
recommends no action at all despite the real policy-gap finding.
