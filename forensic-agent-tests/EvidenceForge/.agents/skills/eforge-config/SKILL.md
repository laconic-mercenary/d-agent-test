description: >
  Add, modify, or remove EvidenceForge personas, DNS domains, applications, traffic profiles,
  spawn rules, and other configuration data that controls how eforge generates realistic baseline
  activity. Use this skill when the user wants to add a persona, add a domain or website, add an
  application, change browsing intensity, update traffic weights, add bash commands, customize
  proxy URI templates, or validate config file integrity — even if they don't say "config".
  This is for changing the underlying data library, not for creating scenarios (use eforge:scenario
  for that) or running generation (use eforge:generate). Trigger on phrases like "add a persona",
  "new domain", "new application", "check my config", "dns registry", "application catalog".

# EvidenceForge Configuration Manager

Before doing anything else, run these commands to establish where to read and write:

```bash
eforge info install_type
eforge info overlay.exists
eforge info overlay.path
eforge info paths.activity
eforge info paths.personas
eforge info identity_pools
```

Do not read files. Do not search. Do not explore. Run the commands above first.

The `eforge info` command has three modes — do not mix them:
- `eforge info <field>` — get one value (e.g., `eforge info personas`, `eforge info paths.activity`)
- `eforge info --fields` — list all available field names (no other arguments)
- `eforge info --json` — get everything as JSON (no other arguments)

**Where to READ** (package defaults): use the paths from `eforge info paths.*`.

**Where to WRITE** (user changes):
- `install_type` is `package` → ALWAYS write to the overlay at `eforge info overlay.path` (create it if `overlay.exists` is False). Never edit package files — they are lost on upgrade.
- `install_type` is `editable` → ask the user: overlay or edit source files directly? Only editable installs (developers working in the repo) should ever edit source files.

When writing to the overlay, files are partial — they contain ONLY the user's new or changed entries. The engine merges them with package defaults automatically. Mirror the package directory structure: `activity/`, `personas/`, etc.

**Rules:**
- Do NOT use `find`, `ls`, `grep`, or `glob` to locate config files — use `eforge info`
- Do NOT read or edit files under `.claude/commands/` (those are read-only skill copies)
- Do NOT edit files under `paths.*` when `config_writable` is `False` — those are inside the installed Python package
- If a domain/IP is needed only for one scenario, put it in that scenario's
  `environment.network_identities` instead of the reusable config overlay. Use
  `dns_registry.yaml` only for domains that should be available across many
  scenarios or selected by package traffic profiles, site maps, proxy URI
  templates, or TLS realism data.

## Step 2: Classify the Operation

| Operation | Primary File(s) | Cascade Files |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Add/retag reusable domain | `dns_registry.yaml` | `traffic_profiles.yaml`, `proxy_uri_templates.yaml`, `site_maps.yaml` |
| Modify traffic patterns | `traffic_profiles.yaml` | `dns_registry.yaml` (validate tags exist) |
| Add/modify application | `application_catalog.yaml` | `spawn_rules.yaml`, `process_network_map.yaml` |
| Add/modify DLL load profile | `application_catalog.yaml` or `system_processes.yaml` | `sysmon_filters.yaml` (Event 7 filter) |
| Create/modify persona | `personas/{name}.yaml` | `application_catalog.yaml` (persona lists), `traffic_profiles.yaml` (persona_traffic) |
| Modify spawn rules | `spawn_rules.yaml` | `application_catalog.yaml` (validate exe exists) |
| Add proxy URI templates | `proxy_uri_templates.yaml` | `dns_registry.yaml` (validate domain exists); use `domain_class` and `referrer_policy` for certificate/update infrastructure |
| Modify proxy User-Agent pools | `proxy_user_agents.yaml` | `dns_registry.yaml` for package/update hostnames |
| Add/modify beacon behavior profiles | `beacon_profiles.yaml` | Scenario `beacon.profile` values reference these synthetic HTTP sequence profiles; keep profiles behavior-shaped, not live IOC replicas |
| Modify HTTP request/file profiles | `http_file_profiles.yaml` | Shared request-content classes and file-extension MIME mappings used by background and authored HTTP file analysis |
| Add site map entries | `site_maps.yaml` | `dns_registry.yaml` (validate domain exists) |
| Modify inbound web visitor mix | `web_session_profiles.yaml` | `site_maps.yaml`, `traffic_rates.yaml`, `timing_profiles.yaml` |
| Modify bash commands | `bash_commands.yaml` | Validate role names match persona names; keep `typo_model` rates/counts realistic |
| Modify traffic rate defaults | `traffic_rates.yaml` | (standalone — intensity-based rate table for all system traffic) |
| Modify systemd schedules | `systemd_schedules.yaml` | (standalone) |
| Modify Sysmon event filtering | `sysmon_filters.yaml` | (standalone — affects which Events 3/7/11/12/13/22 are emitted) |
| Modify EDR diversity pools | `edr_pools.yaml` | (standalone — file paths, registry keys, DLL pool for background events) |
| Modify CallTrace patterns | `calltrace_patterns.yaml` | (standalone — Event 10 ProcessAccess call chain templates) |
| Modify ProcessAccess masks | `process_access_patterns.yaml` | (standalone — Event 10 baseline source/target pairs and GrantedAccess masks) |

The `multipart` section of `http_file_profiles.yaml` controls deterministic
browser/curl/generic boundary morphology, part-header order, safety limits, and
the 15-entry HTTP vector caps. Keep these settings data-driven and synchronized
with the scenario and evidence references.
| Modify CreateRemoteThread pairs | `create_remote_thread_patterns.yaml` | (standalone — Event 8 baseline source/target pairs) |
| Modify TLS chain/OCSP/SNI realism | `tls_realism.yaml` | `dns_registry.yaml` for OCSP responder hosts and domains selected by `dns_tags` |
| Modify Windows auth realism | `windows_auth_realism.yaml` | (standalone — Security log auth timing and failed-logon profile knobs) |
| Modify baseline auth noise | `auth_noise.yaml` | (standalone — stale scheduled-credential accounts and irregular recurrence timing) |
| Modify endpoint background noise | `endpoint_noise.yaml` | (standalone — scheduled-process timing and DHCP registry emission policy) |
| Modify host activity distribution | `host_activity_profiles.yaml` | (standalone — host/persona/role rate-family multipliers, firewall deny bursts, and artifact variants) |
| Modify generated identity pools | `email_background.yaml`, `mail_public_identities.yaml`, `external_actor_profiles.yaml`, `suspicious_benign.yaml`, `command_parameter_pools.yaml` | (standalone fallback/background pools — baseline email domains/local-parts, reserved public mail replacement domains, omitted storyline external IPs, suspicious-benign DNS/connection targets, and command URL/host placeholders). Scenario-authored IPs/domains override these pools. |
| Modify source observation coverage | `observation_profiles.yaml` | Scenario `observation_profile` selects the named profile; generated `OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json` lets eval account for expected gaps; keep `complete` as the default training profile |
| Modify causal/source timing | `timing_profiles.yaml` | (standalone — causal prerequisite, source latency, teardown, and Windows/Sysmon collision-spacing knobs) |
| Add/modify spillage credential families | `activity/secret_families.yaml` | Used by the `spillage` event type — add families (regex/value_template/carriers, incl. OS-aware `process_command_line_windows` carriers), poison markers, vendor fakes, and the host allowlist. Keep the marker INSIDE any high-entropy token in a `value_template`. Overlay-merge by family name. Validate with `eforge validate-config`, which samples every template/`examples` family and re-checks safety (no real-looking key, no non-reserved host) |
| Add/modify adversarial payload families | `activity/payload_families.yaml` | Used by the `adversarial_payload` event type — add families (value_template/surfaces/raw_surfaces/carriers), markers, the canary host, and the host allowlist. Keep a `{marker}` token in every `value_template` and any `{cr}{lf}` forged line marked on both halves. Overlay-merge by family name. Validate with `eforge validate-config`, which synthesizes every family and runs a marker/host self-test (control bytes are allowed; an unmarked forged line or a non-reserved host is rejected) |
| ~~Format definitions~~ | Not user-customizable | Engine internals — requires code changes |
| ~~Evaluation rules~~ | Not user-customizable | Must match format definitions — requires code changes |

Compound operations touch multiple types — identify all of them. For the full dependency map, read `references/config-dependency-graph.md`.

For **validation** requests ("check my config", "validate config files"), run `eforge validate-config`. Do NOT use `eforge validate` (that validates scenario files, not config). Use `eforge validate-config --json` for machine-readable output.

## Step 3: Read Affected Files and Reference Docs

Read package default files from `paths.*` (READ path) to understand existing content. Also check `eforge info overlay.files` — if overlay files already exist for the configs you're modifying, read those too. Entries in the overlay take precedence and you must update them in place rather than creating duplicate entries.

Also read the relevant reference doc for field schemas and conventions:

| Topic | Reference Doc |
|-------|---------------|
| DNS, traffic, proxy, beacon profiles, site maps, network | `references/config-dns-network.md` |
| Applications, spawn rules, processes | `references/config-apps-processes.md` |
| Sysmon filters, EDR pools, CallTrace, ProcessAccess masks, CreateRemoteThread pairs | `references/config-apps-processes.md` (Sysmon sections) |
| Persona file structure | `references/config-personas.md` |
| Host activity (bash, systemd, syslog, endpoint noise) | `references/config-host-activity.md` |
| Generated identity pools | `references/config-dns-network.md` and `references/config-host-activity.md` |
| Timing profiles | `references/config-host-activity.md` |
| Format definitions | `references/config-formats.md` (read-only reference — not user-customizable) |
| Evaluation rules | `references/config-evaluation.md` (read-only reference — not user-customizable) |
| Cross-file dependencies | `references/config-dependency-graph.md` |
| Validation checks | `references/config-validation.md` |
| IDS signatures and alert policy | `references/config-ids.md` |

## Step 4: Interview for Completeness

Ask targeted follow-up questions to ensure the change achieves what the user actually wants. Ask one question at a time.

**Adding a domain:** First ask whether it is scenario-local or reusable. For
scenario-local domains, direct the user to `environment.network_identities` and
`baseline_activity.traffic_affinities` in the scenario. For reusable config
domains, ask what `dns_tags` it needs, whether it should appear in proxy logs,
whether it is browsable with page depth, which personas/roles should select it,
and whether it has multiple IPs.

**Adding a beacon profile:** Run `eforge info beacon_profiles` first to avoid
duplicate names. Keep profile contents synthetic and behavior-shaped: URI shapes,
method/status/byte ranges, User-Agent pools, and deterministic tokens are fine;
do not encode live malware IOC paths, domains, or exact campaign payloads.

**Changing IDS cadence:** Edit the project overlay at
`.eforge/config/activity/ids_signatures.yaml`; entries merge by `sid`. Add or
replace `alert_policy` with `detection_filter`, `event_filter`, or both, or set it
to `every`. Do not copy the whole packaged signature unless its metadata also
needs to change. Read `references/config-ids.md`, run `eforge validate-config`,
and start a fresh CLI process after the edit so cached signature data is reloaded.

**Adding an application:** Which OS(es)? Categories? Which personas? Image path? PE metadata? Command templates? Parent process? Children? Network traffic?

**Creating a persona:** Role description? Typical activities? Work hours (format: "9am-5pm (lunch 12pm-1pm)")? Risk profile (low/medium/high)? Browsing intensity (light/normal/heavy)? Applications? Custom traffic? Linux user?

If you have clear domain knowledge (e.g., "API endpoints get `dev` tag"), use it. Only ask about genuinely ambiguous decisions.

## Step 5: Execute All Changes

Write ALL changes to the WRITE path established in Step 1 — the overlay directory, NOT the package files (unless the user explicitly chose source editing in a dev install).

For overlay files: if the overlay file already exists, read it first and update entries in place. If modifying an entry that's already in the overlay, edit it directly — do not create a second entry with the same key. If the overlay file doesn't exist yet, create it mirroring the package structure (e.g., `<overlay>/activity/application_catalog.yaml`). Include ONLY the new/changed entries — the engine merges with package defaults automatically.

Order of changes:
1. **Primary file first** — the file the user explicitly asked about
2. **Upstream dependencies** — files that need to exist for the primary to work
3. **Downstream cascades** — files that should reflect the primary change

Match existing style from the package files (indentation, quoting, comment grouping).

## Step 6: Verify and Auto-Fix

Run cross-reference checks on the **merged** data (package + overlay). Write auto-fixes to the same WRITE path as the user's changes.

**Auto-fix** (fix and report): missing proxy templates for web/saas domains, missing site maps, persona not in app catalog persona lists, app not in spawn rules.

**Advisory only** (report): app with network traffic but no process_network_map entry, new server role missing traffic profiles, evaluation rules referencing missing fields.

## Step 7: Report

1. **Files modified** — list each and what changed
2. **Auto-fixes applied** — what was added and why
3. **Suggestions** — anything else to consider
