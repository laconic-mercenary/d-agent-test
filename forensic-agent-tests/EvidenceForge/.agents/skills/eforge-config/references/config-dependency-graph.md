# Config File Dependency Graph

> **This is a reference document for the /eforge:config skill.** If you are trying to add, modify, or remove config entries, invoke /eforge:config instead of using this reference directly. This file contains schema details that the config skill reads during execution.
>
> To discover config file paths, run `eforge info <field>` (e.g., `eforge info paths.activity`). Run `eforge info --fields` to see all available fields.

This document maps every cross-file dependency in the EvidenceForge config system. Use it to determine which files need coordinated edits when making any change.

## Project-Local Overlay

Users can customize configs without modifying the package by placing partial YAML files in `.eforge/config/` in their project root. The engine merges overlay entries with package defaults at load time. Run `eforge info overlay.exists` and `eforge info overlay.files` to check overlay status, or `eforge info --fields` to see all available queries.

When adding new entries via the config skill, they go in the overlay directory (not the package files) unless the user is a developer editing the source directly.

Scenario YAML can also declare `environment.network_identities` for
scenario-local host/IP ownership. Use that for one-off lab, partner, attacker,
or public-service identities that should travel with a scenario. Use config
overlays for reusable libraries shared by many scenarios.

Generated identity pools are reusable config, not scenario schema. Use
`activity/email_background.yaml`, `activity/mail_public_identities.yaml`,
`activity/external_actor_profiles.yaml`, `activity/suspicious_benign.yaml`, and
`activity/command_parameter_pools.yaml` for fallback/background identities that
should affect many scenarios. Scenario-authored IPs, domains, mailboxes, and
`environment.network_identities` stay authoritative for a specific scenario.

## Operation Checklists

Use these checklists when performing each type of edit. Items marked with **[auto-fix]** can be stub-generated automatically; items marked with **[advise]** should be flagged to the user.

### Add a Domain

1. Add entry to `dns_registry.yaml` with `domain`, `ips` (list of 1-3), and `tags` (list)
2. If tags include `web` or `saas`:
   - **[auto-fix]** Add proxy_uri_templates entry with generic paths
   - **[auto-fix]** Add site_maps entry with minimal page structure
3. If the domain should appear in specific role/persona traffic:
   - **[advise]** Check that `dns_tags:` in relevant traffic_profiles entries include the domain's tags
4. Group the domain entry under the correct provider comment block

### Remove a Domain

1. Remove entry from `dns_registry.yaml`
2. Remove matching key from `proxy_uri_templates.yaml` (if present)
3. Remove matching key from `site_maps.yaml` (if present)
4. **[advise]** Check if any traffic_profiles entries used a tag that now has no domains

### Retag a Domain

1. Change `tags:` in `dns_registry.yaml`
2. If removing `web`/`saas` tag → proxy_uri_templates and site_maps entries may now be unreachable (harmless but stale)
3. If adding `web`/`saas` tag:
   - **[auto-fix]** Add proxy_uri_templates entry if missing
   - **[auto-fix]** Add site_maps entry if missing
4. **[advise]** Check dns_tags references in traffic_profiles for impact

### Add an Application

1. Add entry to `application_catalog.yaml` with all required fields
2. **[auto-fix]** Add exe basename as child of appropriate parent in `spawn_rules.yaml` (explorer.exe for user apps)
3. If app generates network traffic:
   - **[advise]** Add entry to `process_network_map.yaml`
4. If app spawns child processes:
   - **[auto-fix]** Add parent entry in `spawn_rules.yaml` with children list

### Create a Persona

1. Create `personas/{name}.yaml` with all required fields
2. **[auto-fix]** Add persona name to `personas:` lists in relevant `application_catalog.yaml` entries
3. If persona needs custom traffic:
   - **[advise]** Add `persona_traffic:` entry in `traffic_profiles.yaml`
4. If persona is Linux-oriented:
   - **[advise]** Consider adding role entry in `bash_commands.yaml`

### Modify a Persona

1. Edit `personas/{name}.yaml`
2. If renaming (rare):
   - Update `personas:` lists across `application_catalog.yaml`
   - Update `persona_traffic:` key in `traffic_profiles.yaml`
   - Update role key in `bash_commands.yaml` (if applicable)
   - Rename the YAML file itself

### Add Traffic Profile Entries

1. Add/modify entries in `traffic_profiles.yaml`
2. If using new `dns_tags:` values:
   - Verify tags exist on domains in `dns_registry.yaml`
3. If adding `persona_traffic:` for a new persona:
   - Verify persona file exists in `personas/`

### Modify Spawn Rules

1. Edit `spawn_rules.yaml`
2. Verify all child exe basenames exist in `application_catalog.yaml` or `system_processes.yaml`
3. Verify parent command_templates use correct fully-qualified paths

### Modify ProcessAccess Patterns

1. Edit `process_access_patterns.yaml`
2. Verify each `source_pid_key` and `target_pid_key` refers to a seeded Windows system process
3. Verify every `access_masks:` entry has a hex `mask` and positive `weight`
4. Edit `calltrace_patterns.yaml` separately if changing the Event 10 CallTrace shape

### Modify CreateRemoteThread Patterns

1. Edit `create_remote_thread_patterns.yaml`
2. Verify each `source_pid_key` and `target_pid_key` refers to a seeded Windows system process
3. Verify each `weight` is positive
4. Edit Sysmon Event 8 rendering logic only if changing StartModule/StartFunction selection semantics

### Modify Format Definitions

1. Edit `formats/{name}.yaml`
2. If adding/renaming/removing fields:
   - **[advise]** Check `evaluation/co_occurrence.yaml` for rules referencing changed fields
   - **[advise]** Check `evaluation/distributions.yaml` for distribution profiles referencing changed fields

### Modify Evaluation Rules

1. Edit `evaluation/{name}.yaml`
2. Verify all referenced field names exist in the corresponding format definition
3. Verify all EventID values are valid for the format

## Tag and Name Registries

### Valid DNS Tags
These are the tags used in `dns_registry.yaml` and referenced by `dns_tags:` in
`traffic_profiles.yaml` and `process_network_map.yaml`:

| `git` | Source control services | github.com (also tagged web) |
| `background` | OS-level background HTTPS | telemetry, CRL, OCSP endpoints |
| `windows` | Windows-specific background traffic | windowsupdate.com, msftconnecttest.com |

## Silent Failure Patterns

These are situations where a missing cross-reference doesn't crash the engine but degrades output quality. The skill should proactively check for these.

| Symptom | Cause | Detection |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Generic/unrealistic proxy log URIs | Domain in dns_registry but not in proxy_uri_templates | Grep dns_registry web/saas domains against proxy_uri_templates keys |
| Shallow single-page browsing sessions | Domain in dns_registry but not in site_maps | Grep dns_registry web/saas domains against site_maps keys |
| App processes with wrong image paths | Exe in spawn_rules but not in application_catalog | Grep spawn_rules children against application_catalog ids |
| Persona never spawns expected apps | Persona name missing from application_catalog `personas:` lists | Grep persona filename against application_catalog personas fields |
| Persona traffic falls back to generic [background] | No dns_tags on traffic_profiles entry, or dns_tags point to unused tags | Check dns_tags values against dns_registry tag usage |
| Missing process-network correlation | App generates traffic but has no process_network_map entry | Check network-capable apps against process_network_map keys and `dns_tags` |
| Stale proxy templates for removed domains | Domain removed from dns_registry but template remains | Grep proxy_uri_templates keys against dns_registry domains |
