# AGENTS.md — d-agent-test

This folder holds two related, separately-tracked projects (see `README.md`
for the split), plus a dependency on a third location that lives outside
this folder entirely. This doc is the procedure for going from "an idea for
a case" to "a graded case in `forensic-agent-tests`."

**Scenario generation happens outside this repo, in a real EvidenceForge
checkout**: `/Users/mlcs/Documents/github/EvidenceForge` —
[Cisco-Talos/EvidenceForge](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/EvidenceForge)
(MIT). Do all authoring/iteration there, not in `forensic-agent-tests`. Only
finished, validated scenarios get ported over.

## Phase 1 — Generate a scenario in EvidenceForge

```bash
cd /Users/mlcs/Documents/github/EvidenceForge
uv sync                          # first time / after a pull — see "Environment setup" below
uv run eforge validate scenarios/<slug>/scenario.yaml
uv run eforge generate scenarios/<slug>/scenario.yaml --verbose --force
uv run eforge eval scenarios/<slug>/data --scenario scenarios/<slug>/scenario.yaml --verbose   # optional
```

Use that checkout's own `eforge-scenario`/`eforge-generate`/`eforge-validate`/
`eforge-evaluate` skills for authoring — don't re-derive scenario schema from
memory or from the vendored copy in `forensic-agent-answers/EvidenceForge/`
(stale, see "Known pitfalls" below).

Before moving to Phase 2, record: the scenario slug, the `generation_seed`
(in `data/COLLECTION_PROFILE.json` after generation), and the EvidenceForge
commit (`git -C /Users/mlcs/Documents/github/EvidenceForge rev-parse HEAD`
plus the version in `pyproject.toml`). These three facts are the only
non-rederivable provenance — everything else in the output can be
regenerated from the scenario file.

### Environment setup (if `uv sync` fails)

On this machine, `uv sync` needs a working Rust toolchain to compile
`cryptography` from source (no prebuilt wheel for this platform/Python
combination). If it fails with `openssl-sys` / `pkg-config not found`:

```bash
brew install pkgconf openssl@3
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix openssl@3)/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
cd /Users/mlcs/Documents/github/EvidenceForge && uv sync
```

## Phase 2 — Port a generated scenario into forensic-agent-tests

Never point an agent-under-test at anything generated directly in the
EvidenceForge checkout. Every port-over goes through this checklist, in
order — steps 3 and 4 exist because skipping them has already shipped a
real answer leak once.

1. **Copy the generator input.** `scenario.yaml` only (not `ENVIRONMENT.md`
   — that's case content, see step 2) into
   `forensic-agent-answers/generators/evidenceforge/<slug>/scenario.yaml`,
   plus a `README.md` recording the EvidenceForge version/commit, the seed,
   and the exact `eforge generate` command to reproduce it. This lives in
   `forensic-agent-answers/`, not `forensic-agent-tests/` — a
   `scenario.yaml` is effectively the ground truth in YAML form (the exact
   storyline every exam question is graded against), so it belongs with
   the held-out answer material, not in the AUT-facing repo.

2. **Split the generated output.**
   - `data/` (the logs) + `ENVIRONMENT.md` → `cases/<slug>/data/`
   - `GROUND_TRUTH.md`, `GROUND_TRUTH.json`, `KNOWN_DEFICIENCIES.md` →
     `forensic-agent-answers/case-<slug>/supporting/`
   - `COLLECTION_PROFILE.json`, `OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json`,
     `OUTPUT_TARGET.txt` → **do not carry these into `cases/`.** See "Known
     pitfalls" below. If a future EvidenceForge version needs one of these
     for something legitimate, re-derive the decision fresh against that
     version's actual field content — don't assume the pattern still holds.

3. **Audit the entire intended `cases/<slug>/` tree** (not just `data/`)
   before writing anything else:
   - grep case-insensitive for `evidenceforge|eforge|cisco.?talos|talos` —
     zero hits anywhere the AUT can read, including `README.md` and
     `CHANGELOG.md`, not just `data/`.
   - grep for `"storyline_id"|"kind": *"red_herring"|"activity":` — a
     narrative/answer leak pattern. Any match means that file does not
     belong in `cases/<slug>/`, regardless of what it's named or what its
     schema is documented to be for.
   - Don't trust a sidecar file's stated purpose over its actual rendered
     content for this specific scenario — read it.

4. **Verify claims against the raw data, not against `GROUND_TRUTH.md`
   alone** before writing a grading key. EvidenceForge's own ground truth
   can diverge from what's actually rendered (e.g. `rdp-remote-file-write`'s
   ~21-minute timing gap between the authored offset and the rendered
   `4624`/Sysmon evidence). Pull exact timestamps/fields/identifiers from
   the log files themselves.

5. **Write the case bundle**: `README.md` (human-facing, no
   provenance/brand mentions), `AGENTS.md` (thin router + evidence index,
   also no provenance), `TASK.md`, `EXAM.md` (questions only, no framing),
   `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore` (containing `QUESTION_ANSWERS.md`).

6. **Write the answer bundle** in
   `forensic-agent-answers/case-<slug>/`: `BRIEFING.md` (true story,
   decoys, undetermined facts, known evidence quirks), `AGENTS.md` (grader
   instructions), `grading_schema.md` (per-question rubric, 1:1 with
   `EXAM.md`).

7. **Sanity-check every exam question against the raw data for internal
   contradictions** before finalizing — mismatched process lineage, causal
   ordering that doesn't hold up, fields that contradict `ENVIRONMENT.md`.
   A question resting on self-contradictory evidence isn't hard, it's
   broken. Reword if the fix doesn't change what's being tested; drop the
   question and let a broader one (e.g. full timeline reconstruction)
   absorb its intent if not; hold the whole case out of active use if the
   contradiction sits on more than one graded fact. Don't paper over a data
   problem with grading-key language alone.

8. **Update `forensic-agent-tests/README.md`'s case table.**

## Known pitfalls (read before repeating any of this work)

- **The root `.gitignore`'s `forensic-agent-answers/` entry is
  comment-only — there is no actual ignore pattern under it**, confirmed
  by `git check-ignore`. The comment states intent ("must never enter
  this repo's history") and even claims a "public `origin` remote,"
  but the repo's actual remote (`laconic-mercenary/d-agent-test`) is
  confirmed **private** via `gh repo view`, and `forensic-agent-answers/`
  has in fact already been committed and pushed there — the gitignore
  never worked as intended. This is a known, accepted state: the user's
  explicit instruction was not to remediate it (no `git rm --cached`, no
  history purge, no fixing the pattern) — the intended fix is a future
  manual hand-pick into two properly separated repos, not something to
  do unilaterally mid-session. Don't assume "it's in
  `forensic-agent-answers/`" means "the AUT can't reach it" while both
  live in the same, actually-tracked repo — the directory boundary is
  organizational (and matters for the eventual split), not a real
  access-control boundary yet. (A `git mv` of an already-tracked file
  into `forensic-agent-answers/` stages cleanly as a rename, same as any
  other tracked-to-tracked move — there's no gitignore interaction to
  work around, despite what an earlier version of this note assumed.)
- `generators/evidenceforge/<slug>/` and the vendored `EvidenceForge/`
  skills/reference copy live in `forensic-agent-answers/`, not
  `forensic-agent-tests/` (moved there mid-project after realizing both
  were sitting in the AUT-facing repo). Two separate reasons, don't
  conflate them: (1) a case's `scenario.yaml` is effectively its ground
  truth in YAML form — the literal storyline every exam question is
  graded against — so it belongs with held-out material on principle,
  independent of the point below; (2) the vendored `EvidenceForge/`
  directory is a literal, unmissable brand-name string sitting as a
  top-level directory name, which directly contradicts every
  file-content leak-audit grep this project runs. If you're authoring a
  new case, write its `generators/evidenceforge/<slug>/` output into
  `forensic-agent-answers/`, not `forensic-agent-tests/` — see Phase 2
  step 1 above.
- The vendored `forensic-agent-answers/EvidenceForge/.agents/skills/`
  copy is stale relative to the live checkout — current EvidenceForge
  ships skills under `commands/eforge/*.md`, not `.agents/skills/eforge-*/`,
  and the vendored `scenario-reference.md` is behind by dozens of lines.
  Don't treat it as authoritative.
- A case can look internally consistent in `GROUND_TRUTH.md` and still be
  wrong in the rendered data — cross-source timing/identity fields
  (process parent images, domain/SID fields, event ordering at sub-second
  granularity) have shipped real contradictions before (mismatched
  parent-process binary vs. declared `services`, a domain-style SID in a
  scenario declaring no AD, an effect rendered before its cause). Spot-check
  the fields a graded question actually depends on, not just whether
  `eforge validate`/`eforge eval` passed.
- `grep -a` on a binary artifact (`.evtx` and similar) is not a reliable
  leak audit — binary EVTX stores text as UTF-16 inside a compressed
  structure, and ASCII grep only catches some substrings by accident, not
  all of them (`windows-log-search-basics` shipped with an undetected
  bare-brand-name and a plaintext-password leak inside two `.evtx` files
  because the original audit only checked `grep -a` against the binary).
  To actually audit binary evidence, convert it to text first (e.g.
  `evtx_dump -o jsonl`), grep the converted text, then decide from there.
- When transcribing an answer key from source material that includes
  screenshots (Event Viewer, a UI, anything rendering a timestamp), the
  displayed time may be in the *screenshot tool's local timezone*, not
  UTC — even when the underlying raw data field genuinely is UTC.
  `windows-log-search-basics` shipped with every timestamp in its answer
  key wrong by exactly 9 hours (JST vs. UTC) because the transcription
  copied times straight off the source PDF's screenshots without
  cross-checking the raw data's own timestamp field. This is the same
  "verify against raw data, not the narrative" rule already in this list,
  but the failure mode is easy to miss specifically because a screenshot
  *looks like* raw data — it isn't. Always independently pull the
  timestamp from the actual evidence file's own timezone-stamped field
  before writing it into `BRIEFING.md`/`grading_schema.md`, especially for
  any source not authored in UTC-adjacent timezones.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` is the file most likely to leak something**, not
  `README.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`EXAM.md`. It happened three times in one
  session (the generator brand name, twice; a case's decoy account names,
  once) — always writing it last, in "explain what I just did" narrative
  mode, pulls in whatever's fresh in context (a brand name, a decoy
  account, an internal detail) without the same scrutiny applied to the
  more obviously AUT-facing files. Run the leak grep on `CHANGELOG.md`
  specifically, every time, even when the rest of the case tree is
  already clean.
- Baseline-generated "legitimate" cross-segment traffic does not
  appear to be fully gated by a scenario's declared firewall
  `policy:` rules the way explicitly-authored storyline/scan traffic
  is — confirmed in `websqli-webshell-pivot`, where the declared
  policy listed exactly one DMZ→internal exception (port 445) but the
  rendered `cisco_asa.log` also showed baseline monitoring-style
  traffic (health-check polling, ICMP, background SSH noise) crossing
  the same boundary on other ports the policy never listed. By
  contrast, `external-recon-no-breach`'s firewall cleanly gated all of
  that scenario's (fully attacker-authored) port-scan traffic. Don't
  assume a declared `policy:` block is the sole source of truth for
  what crosses a segment boundary in the rendered data — check the
  actual ASA/Zeek output for baseline noise before writing an
  `ENVIRONMENT.md` claim like "no other traffic is permitted."
- **Never use the `adversarial_payload` storyline event type in any case
  whose evidence reaches the agent-under-test.** It is a hard,
  unconditional safety guardrail in the engine itself (see
  `src/evidenceforge/config/activity/payload_families.yaml`'s
  `default_marker`): every payload it renders — regardless of family,
  surface, or scenario content — carries the literal string
  `EFORGE_TEST` on every line, by design, with no way to disable it.
  That string directly matches this project's own leak-audit grep
  (`evidenceforge|eforge`) and would appear in whatever surface the
  payload is injected into (a URL, a user agent, a syslog line, a
  process command line). Model attacker-controlled HTTP/log content a
  different way instead — e.g. a plain `connection` event with
  `service: http` and a hand-written URI/query string carrying the
  injection shape you want (SQLi, XSS, log-forging, etc.) — which gives
  full control over the rendered content and carries no such marker.
- A leak grep on a raw file only catches plaintext substrings — it does
  not see anything hiding behind an encoding. `phishing-c2-beacon`'s
  generated `.eml` email artifact had a synthetic attachment body whose
  base64-encoded filler content, once decoded, spelled out the
  scenario's own storyline event ID in plain text
  (`email-attachment:evt-phish-001-...`) — a raw-text grep against the
  `.eml` file found nothing, because the string only exists after
  base64 decoding. Same category of miss as the `grep -a`-on-binary-EVTX
  pitfall above, different encoding. Before porting any generated
  artifact that carries base64/hex/other encoded binary content
  (`.eml` files, attachments, anything with a `Content-Transfer-Encoding:
  base64` part) into a case's AUT-facing `data/`, decode and inspect it
  first — don't trust a clean grep on the raw file.
- `AuthenticationPackageName` (Kerberos vs. NTLM) on rendered network
  logons is a fixed 70/30 random roll in this engine version
  (`_select_auth_package` in
  `src/evidenceforge/generation/activity/generator.py`), completely
  independent of whether the account is domain- or local-scoped.
  Confirmed by reading the engine source after `pth-lateral-logclear`'s
  first design (a local-admin credential meant to render reliably as
  NTLM, distinguishing it from Kerberos-authenticated legitimate
  traffic) produced a near-random mix instead — only 1 of 6 attacker
  logon events came out NTLM. There is no scenario-authoring path to
  force deterministic auth-package rendering for a specific account;
  design the exam around the account's identity/timing pattern
  instead, and treat any auth-package observation as a secondary,
  non-required signal at most.
- `log_cleared` does not remove any preceding events from the affected
  host's own rendered log in this engine version — it is purely
  additive (adds the Event ID 1102 record without suppressing anything
  before it). Confirmed independently in both `pth-lateral-logclear`
  and `dga-beacon-logclear`: the host's own prior evidence (a logon,
  a process-creation event) remained fully present and citable after
  the clear. Don't design a case around "this evidence is now
  destroyed" without verifying that claim directly against the
  rendered output first — instead, a good use of this event type is
  testing whether the agent-under-test *verifies* the clear's actual
  effect rather than assuming a clear attempt necessarily succeeded.
- Declaring an account under `environment.service_accounts` reliably
  produces baseline Event ID 4648 ("explicit credential usage") noise
  from `SYSTEM`-context automated processes (`taskhostw.exe`,
  `ops-agent.exe`, and — confirmed in `rogue-service-account-privcreep`
  — sometimes `powershell.exe` too) — and this noise is **not confined
  to the one host you'd narratively expect**. Confirmed across four
  cases this session (`credential-spray-domain-compromise`,
  `pth-lateral-logclear`, `benign-breakglass-account`,
  `rogue-service-account-privcreep`): the noise consistently spans
  *every* host in the environment the account has any plausible reason
  to touch, not just the one server hosting its "documented" job. An
  early answer-key draft for `rogue-service-account-privcreep` listed
  only 3 of the actual 4 hosts carrying this noise and claimed the
  process name alone was a reliable discriminator — both wrong, caught
  by an independent audit. When characterizing this baseline for an
  exam, check **every** host in the scenario, not just the obvious
  one, and confirm which field (usually `SubjectUserName`, not
  `ProcessName` or `IpAddress`) is actually the reliable signal by
  checking what baseline noise renders, not by assuming it from the
  process names the scenario happens to reference.
- Any `roles:` assignment can trigger the engine's own built-in
  "legitimate lateral movement" baseline patterns
  (`src/evidenceforge/config/activity/network_params.yaml`) connecting
  hosts by role pairing (e.g. any `web_server`-role host automatically
  gets baseline SMB traffic to any `file_server`-role host, modeled as
  a content-publishing pattern) — confirmed in `websqli-webshell-pivot`,
  where this silently generated realistic-looking "legitimate" traffic
  toward a host a case's premise required to have no legitimate
  visitors at all. If a case's design depends on a host having *no*
  baseline traffic from a particular role, don't just declare the
  target's role and assume — generate once, grep the rendered
  ASA/Zeek/Windows output for unexpected connections to that host, and
  remove the role (or pick a target role with no such pairing) if the
  premise doesn't hold.
- When delegating an audit (or any read-only investigation) of a case with
  compressed evidence (`.tar.gz` in `data/`), don't instruct the agent to
  unpack with `-C data/` — that leaves raw, uncompressed evidence sitting
  in the real case directory afterward, undoing the compression and
  getting staged alongside the compressed originals on the next
  `git add`. This happened twice in one session. Either tell the agent to
  unpack into a scratch/temp location instead, or explicitly tell it to
  clean up its extraction when done, and always `git status`/`ls` the
  case's `data/` directory after any delegated audit completes, before
  staging anything.
